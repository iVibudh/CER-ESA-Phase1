Therefore, based on the ‚principal project/a\\nccessory test™ provided by the \\nCanadian Environmental \\nAssessment Act \\nTraining Compendium (Canadian Envi\\nronmental Assessment Agency \\n1994), the ‚scope of the project™ \\nfrom the perspective of the \\nCanadian Environmental Assessment Act \\ncan be defined as the physical works \\nassociated with the construction and \\noperation of the Pipeline only.  Project details are provided in Volume 1 of\\n the Application document. The information \\npresented in this Volume 2 represents a summary\\n of relevant details \\nthat will assist the \\nreader in better understanding the environmental implications of the Project. \\n13.2.2 Pipeline Details \\n13.2.2.1 Routing Alternatives \\nDuring the initial planning stages for this Project, three r\\nouting alternatives were considered \\nfor moving gas from the EnCana Sierra Gas \\nPlant to the NGTL Northwest Mainline \\nPipeline. Since there were no obvious biophysical or land use constraints between the tie-in points, options were developed \\nthat maximized the use of existing linear corridors (e.g., \\nseismic lines, roads and utility RO\\nWs) and that offered acceptable crossing locations of \\nmajor streams.  \\nMore detailed analysis was done for these thr\\nee alternatives and public consultation (the \\nNorth, Mid-route and South Alte\\nrnatives). All three alternat\\nives have a common alignment \\nfrom the EnCana Sierra Gas Plant to the cro\\nssing of Kyklo Creek 20.6 km to the east. All \\nfollow an existing pipeline and dry-weather access road to \\nthe creek, and then require \\napproximately 1.1 km of new ROW to cross \\nthe creek. The remaining segments of the \\nalternatives are discu\\nssed in the following: \\nNorth Alternative. On the south side of the Kyklo Cr\\neek crossing, this alternative heads \\neast along seismic lines to the Hay River ar\\nea (a distance of approximately 32.2 km), \\nshifting from seismic lines for 2 km to avoi\\nd stream meanders associ\\nated with Kotcho River \\nand for an additional 2 km to improve crossing locations at Townsoitoi Creek and a tributary to Townsoitoi Creek. From the Hay River, the \\nroute travels southeast for approximately 7.7 \\nkm before rejoining an east-west trending seismi\\nc line. Immediately west of the Little Hay \\nRiver, this routing encounters a relatively \\nextensive Nexen oil field development for \\napproximately 11 of the 20.9 km\\n. Through much of this area,\\n the route will require new \\n'"
