Streams generally have low fish habitat diversity and capacity. Channels are \\ninvariably sinuous, low gradient (<1 percent) with substrates dominated by fines.  \\n\\nThe Hay River rises in the Naylor Hills of northwestern Alberta, flows westward into British \\nColumbia before turning northeast back into Alberta, then north into the Northwest \\nTerritories and eventually into Great Slave Lake. Fish biodiversity in the British Columbia \\nportion of the Hay River is low, with only nine species (six non-game or forage species and \\nthree game species) ever recorded, compared to 52 species in the Mackenzie System \\nupstream of Great Slave Lake and 16 species for the Alberta portion of the Hay River \\n(McPhail et al. 1998; Nelson and Paetz 1992).  \\n\\nPrevious records of fish from the British Columbia portion of the Hay River watershed are \\nsummarized in Table 13.8-1. The three game fish species include; walleye (Stizostedion \\nvitreum), burbot (Lota lota), and northern pike (Esox lucius). These previous records \\nindicate that walleye and burbot are sporadic in occurrence and not present in sufficient \\nnumbers to support recreational fisheries (Table 13.8-1). The three walleye collected were \\nall in areas characterize by coarse substrates (McPhail et al. 1998). Only the widely \\ndistributed northern pike may possibly support a recreational fishery in the BC portion of the \\nHay River watershed. The six non-game species include: lake chub (Couesius plumbeus), \\nfinescale dace (Phoxinus neogaeus), longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus), white \\nsucker (Catostomus commersoni), trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) and brook \\nstickleback (Culaea inconstans). None of these species are red or blue listed in British \\nColumbia. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT \\n\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN \\n\\n Page 13-151 \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nTable 13.8-1 Records of Fish Collected from the British Columbia Portion of the Hay River Watershed \\n\\nDate Location Site (UTM) Reference Sampling Methods1 Species Collected2 \\nJune 3, 1960 Kotcho Lake 10.601000.6550000 UBC seine, GN NP.

Migration to \\nspawning areas occurs at or following ice breakup. Spawning occurs in natural lakes, \\nreservoirs and rivers. Walleye broadcast spawn preferably over wind-exposed rocky shoals \\nin lakes or clean gravel/cobble/boulder (riffle) sections in rivers with moderate current \\nvelocities. Seldom do walleye spawn in sheltered bays or in sand/silt-bottom backwater \\nareas since their eggs perish on silt or sand bottoms \\n(www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/fhp/fish/walleye/habitat.htm). Walleye prefer low clarity \\nwater, characteristic of bog-stained lakes and rivers, with optimum transparencies in the \\nrange of one to two metres. On bright days, adult walleye have been observed to hold in \\ndeep pools utilizing overhead cover consisting of large woody debris, boulders, and weed \\nbeds. Although riverine juvenile walleye utilize cobble and boulder substrate for overhead \\ncover, very little is actually known regarding habitat requirements.  \\n\\nNorthern Pike \\n\\nNorthern pike overwinter in relatively deep lakes and rivers. At ice breakup, northern pike \\nmove inshore or upstream to flooded marshes, wetlands or shallow shoreline inundations. \\nOptimum spawning substrate is a dense mat of short vegetation in a shallow, wind-\\nsheltered area (Inskip 1982). Spawning occurs when these shallows reach 8 to 12°C. Eggs \\nare broadcast over vegetative hummocks and mats which entrap the eggs and suspend \\nthem above the substrate, where anoxic conditions can develop (Casselman and Lewis \\n1996). Optimum nursery habitat is dense submergent and emergent aquatic vegetation \\nproviding 40 to 90 percent cover and a location contiguous to spawning habitat. Optimum \\nextent is greater than 10 times the size of the adjacent spawning habitat (Casselman and \\nLewis 1996). Adult and juvenile northern pike prefer habitat that is relatively shallow, clear, \\ncool, and well oxygenated. Northern pipe exhibit a preference for type and density of \\nvegetative cover (Casselman and Lewis 1996).  \\n\\nBurbot \\n\\nAdult burbot reside in deep pools in rivers and the hypolimnion of lakes. They spawn in \\nwinter, from mid-December to early April. Spawning occurs at night, under ice cover, where \\nburbot congregate in relatively shallow water over substrate composed of clean sand, \\ngravel and stones (Morel 1980). Burbot spawn in a ball or globular mass of fish. Eggs and \\nsperm are broadcast into the water column; demersal eggs randomly settle on the bottom. \\nEggs hatch in 70 days at 0 to 4°C. Juvenile burbot frequently reside along rocky shores and \\nweedy areas of tributary streams.  \\n\\nLongnose Sucker \\n\\nLongnose sucker overwinter in lake and river areas that provide adequate oxygen and \\nsuitable depth. Spawning movements begin after ice-off at temperatures of 5 to 9°C (Geen \\net al. 1966). Spawning itself occurs at 10 to 15°C as eggs are broadcast over clean gravel \\n\\nhttp://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/fhp/fish/walleye/habitat.htm\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-154\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nand rock (1 to 20 cm) riffle areas with current velocities in the range of 0.3 to 1.0 m/s \\n(Edwards 1982). Longnose suckers also spawn along wave-swept shorelines, at depths 15 \\nto 30 cm (Geen et al. 1966). Fry remain in the gravel for one to two weeks, then emerge to \\ndrift downstream primarily at night. Peak fry migration is usually one month after spawning \\n(Geen et al. 1966). Fry spend their first year in riverine conditions and seek food and \\nshelter in shallow, quiet water with vegetation cover. Fry congregate in the top 150 mm of \\nwater and within 2 m of shore (Hayes 1956). Although adult longnose sucker are more \\nassociated with lakes, they are well-adapted to high current velocities in stony-bottomed \\nrivers (Walton 1980). \\n\\nWhite Sucker \\n\\nWhite sucker overwinter in lakes and rivers with deep pools and low velocities. White \\nsucker utilize overhead cover elements such as undercut banks, large woody debris, \\nboulders and vegetation in lotic habitats (Hayes 1956). Spawning movements usually occur \\nfrom lakes to streams after ice-off when stream temperatures reach 10°C (Geen et al. \\n1966). Preferred spawning occurs in streams over shallow, gravel substrates; however, \\nspawning may even occur in rapids (Scott and Crossman 1973). Juvenile white sucker \\nutilized instream cover elements such as vegetation, woody debris and undercut banks; 50 \\npercent total instream cover is considered optimum (Anon 1981). Instream cover becomes \\nmore important in those streams lacking pools. White sucker juveniles reside in shallow \\nwater, close to shore in mainstem channels and confluence areas of tributary streams to \\nmainstem channels (McPhail et al. 1998). \\n\\nLake Chub \\n\\nLake chub are widely distributed across Canada and are the most abundant and widely \\ndistributed fish species collected in the Hay River watershed (McPhail et al. 1998). This \\nindicates a tolerance to a wide range of habitat conditions. Although habitat preferences \\nare unclear, lake chub can successfully reside in rivers in regions where lakes are not \\navailable (Scott and Crossman 1973). Lake chub overwinter in lakes and deeper parts of \\nlarge rivers. Large school spawning movements from lakes to streams have been observed \\nto occur April to August (Morel 1980). Broadcast spawning is conducted in over rocky and \\ngravel bottoms of rivers and streams. Post spawning movements back to lakes and deep \\nparts of rivers have been noted in the literature (Scott and Crossman 1973). \\n\\nTrout-Perch \\n\\nTrout-Perch are widely distributed across North America. They are typically found in deep \\nwater of lakes (depths of 10 to 61 metres) and in long, deep pools in rivers. Spawning \\nmovements occur in late spring and summer, as spawning fish move inshore or into \\ntributary streams to lakes. Spawning occurs near the surface of the water column; \\ndemersal eggs sink to the bottom and adhere to whatever the eggs settle on (Scott and \\nCrossman 1973). In lotic environments, trout-perch utilize overhead cover composed of \\nlarge woody debris and undercut banks (Morel 1980). Juveniles seem to prefer mainstem \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-155\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nchannels and confluence areas of tributary streams to mainstem channels. Trout-perch \\nfeed at night in shallow water and then return to deep water habitats during the day. They \\nare considered valuable forage fish for the three species of game fish that inhabit the Hay \\nRiver watershed in British Columbia (Scott and Crossman 1973). \\n\\nFinescale Dace \\n\\nAlthough finescale dace are tolerant of large river conditions, preferred habitat appears to \\nbe the cool bog-stained lakes, ponds and streams with dense aquatic vegetation, soft \\nsubstrates and lots of submerged woody debris. They co-exist with brook stickleback in \\nthese environs. Nelson and Paetz (1970) reported these species survive due to a high \\ntolerance to the low oxygen conditions commonly found in boggy streams and beaver \\nponds. Both species use overhead aquatic vegetation, brush, logs and ice for cover. \\nFinescale dace spawn after ice-off (April to July) in the cover of submerged brush and logs. \\nThe fertilized eggs sink to the bottom and receive no care from either parent. The male \\nbrook stickleback, on the other hand, build a nest on the stems of reeds or grass close to, \\nor on, the bottom. Males guard and defend the nest until the fertilized eggs hatch. \\n\\n13.8.1.2 Stream Habitats at Proposed Crossing Sites \\n\\nThe proposed Project crosses the following eight defined water courses. Detailed fisheries \\nand habitat surveys are proposed for the spring period (May 2003) at these crossings to \\ninvestigate use and habitat conditions, and to assist in the development of final crossing \\ndesign plans for these streams. The crossing descriptions provided here are based on \\noverview investigations undertaken in October and December 2003: \\n\\n13.8.1.2.1 Kyklo Creek \\n\\nKyklo Creek is a low gradient (<0.1 percent), meandering channel with numerous oxbow \\nsloughs contiguous to the mainstem channel. Channel width is approximately 17 to 22 \\nmetres in the vicinity of the proposed crossing (Appendix 13A, Sheet 4). Top of bank height \\napproaches two metres. Channel substrate is predominantly fines (sand) and the stream \\nhabitat type is run with no riffle structure present within the study reach. The downstream \\nreach break is located at the confluence of Klicho Creek. \\n\\nInstream vegetation, small woody debris and stream depth appear to be the major \\ncontributors to instream cover. Kyklo Creek appears to have moderate overwintering \\npotential, with bankfull depths to two metres and moderate flow (Anon 2002). However, \\nduring geotechnical investigations undertaken in February 2003 at the crossing site, the \\nstream was found to be frozen to its substrates, indicating no to minimal overwintering \\npotential in some years.  \\n\\nBrook stickleback reside in Kyklo Creek; while, finescale dace and longnose sucker \\njuveniles were collected in Klicho Creek, a major tributary stream to Kyklo Creek (Table \\n13.8-1). It is interesting that northern pike were collected in neither Kyklo Creek nor Klicho \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-156\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nCreek, where there is habitat for spawning, incubation and juvenile rearing. An absence of \\nnorthern pike in September suggests possible downstream movement to preferred \\noverwintering habitat in Kotcho River or Hay River had occurred. \\n\\n13.8.1.2.2 Unnamed Tributary to Kotcho River \\n\\nThis small drainage has been heavily modified by beaver activity. The proposed route has \\nbeen shifted several hundred metres south of a more direct east-west alignment to \\nencounter the stream upstream of the beaver impoundments (Appendix 13A, Sheet 6). The \\nchannel width at the crossing site is less than two metres and poorly defined. Substrate is \\npredominantly fines. Fish use is unknown; it is suspected that only brook stickleback and \\nfinscale dace are likely present in the vicinity of the proposed crossing.  \\n\\n13.8.1.2.3 Townsoitoi Creek \\n\\nTownsoitoi Creek is a large, low gradient tributary to the Kotcho River. Channel width is in \\nthe range 20 to 40 metres and bankfull depth is 1.5 metres at a measured site (Anon 2002). \\nHabitat is classified as a slow-deep run. No riffle structure was observed in the Townsoitoi \\nCreek channel. Substrate is predominantly fines with abundant instream vegetation. Habitat \\nappears suitable for northern pike spawning and juvenile rearing. Although burbot, \\nfinescale dace, northern pike and white suckers were captured at the confluence of \\nTownsoitoi Creek and Kotcho River September 9, 1997; only brook stickleback and \\nfinescale dace were captured in Townsoitoi Creek on September 22, 2002 (McPhail et al. \\n1997; Anon 2002; Table 13.8-1). The absence of northern pike adult and juveniles from \\ncollections in Townsoitoi Creek in September 2002 may indicate downstream movement to \\npreferred overwintering habitat in Kotcho River or Hay River.  \\n\\nOn the west side of the stream, the proposed crossing has been shifted approximately 100 \\nmetres north of an east-west trending seismic line to avoid beaver impoundments, wetter \\nterrain and improve site conditions for directional drill set-up (Appendix 13A, Sheet 8). \\nChannel width is approximately 12 to 15 metres; bank height is variable to 2 metres. \\nTownsoitoi Creek appears to have some overwintering potential, as it is large enough to \\nsupport some free water flow beneath the ice cover. However, low dissolved oxygen levels \\nmay limit overwinter utilization to brook stickleback and finscale dace. During geotechnical \\ninvestigations undertaken in February 2003 at the crossing site, the stream was found to be \\nfrozen to its substrates, indicating no to minimal overwintering potential in some years. \\n\\n13.8.1.2.4 Unnamed Tributary #1 to Townsoitoi Creek \\n\\nThis small drainage has been heavily modified by beaver activity upstream of the proposed \\ncrossing (Appendix 13A, Sheet 9). The route encounters a poorly defined channel \\nimmediately downstream of a large beaver dam, and there is a high probability that the \\nchannel freezes to the substrate. Fisheries values are suspected to be zero. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-157\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.8.1.2.5 Unnamed Tributary #2 to Townsoitoi Creek \\n\\nThis slow moving tributary appears to be shallow with limited overwintering potential. The \\nproposed crossing has been shifted approximately 100 m south of an east-wet trending \\nseismic line to avoid a significant widening of the channel (Appendix 13A, Sheet 9). At the \\nproposed crossing site, the channel is less than 5 m wide, with low bank structure and \\npredominantly fine substrates. Winter fisheries values are suspected to be zero. \\n\\n13.8.1.2.6 Hay River \\n\\nThe Hay River mainstem is a low gradient, meandering channel with bankfull widths \\nranging from 40 to 45 m and bank top widths exceeding 5 m (Appendix 13A, Sheet 9). \\nNumerous oxbow sloughs providing high water fish refuge, flank the mainstem channel. \\nSubstrates are dominated by fines. Overhead cover is limited. Large woody debris is \\nsporadic with a clumped distribution, usually on meander bends. Habitat type is \\npredominantly run. There are no typical riffle-pool sequences as there are no hard points. \\nBankfull depth at the proposed crossing location is variable to two metres. Bank top height \\nis variable to five metres.  \\n\\nThe Hay River has the highest potential for overwintering fish of all the watercourses \\nencountered on the proposed route, with anticipated winter flows in some years of between \\none and two m3s-1. However, during geotechnical investigations undertaken in February \\n2003 at the crossing site, the stream was found to be frozen to its substrates, indicating no \\nto minimal overwintering potential in some years. With the possible exception of burbot, the \\nHay River mainstem does not provide suitable spawning habitat for game-fish species in \\nthe low gradient, meandering channel downstream of the proposed crossing site. \\n\\n13.8.1.2.7 Unnamed Tributary to Hay River \\n\\nSeveral large beaver dams downstream of the proposed crossing site have modified this \\nstream (Appendix 13A, Sheet 10). The dams have resulted in a 25 to 30 m wide shallow \\nimpoundment channel with limited overwintering potential for fish. December discharge \\nnear the confluence of this channel with the Hay River was measured at less than \\n0.2 m3s-1. During geotechnical investigations undertaken in February 2003 at the crossing \\nsite, the stream was found to be frozen to its substrates, indicating no to minimal \\noverwintering potential. Winter fisheries values are suspected to be zero. \\n\\n13.8.1.2.8 Little Hay River \\n\\nLittle Hay River is a low gradient (<1 percent), meandering channel with numerous oxbow \\nsloughs contiguous to the mainstem channel. Channel width is approximately 10 to 12 \\nmetres in the vicinity of the proposed crossing (Appendix 13A, Sheet 13). Bank height is \\nvariable to two metres, while channel substrate is predominantly sandy-fines. Stream \\nhabitat type in the vicinity of the proposed crossing site is run. Stream depth and ice cover \\nappears to be the major sources of overhead cover for fish, as woody debris, undercut \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-158\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nbank, boulder, and instream vegetation cover appears to be poor to non-existent. Little Hay \\nRiver is suspected to provide moderate overwintering and perhaps spawning habitat for \\nburbot. However, during geotechnical investigations undertaken in February 2003 at the \\ncrossing site, the stream was found to be frozen to its substrates, indicating no to minimal \\noverwintering potential in some years. Based on preliminary investigations, suitable \\nspawning and summer rearing habitat for walleye and northern pike does not appear to \\nexist within one km of the proposed crossing site.  \\n\\n13.8.1.3 Field Survey Program \\n\\nTo verify elements of the baseline information discussed above, and to provide additional \\ndetail for the mitigation strategies discussed in the following sections, a Fish Habitat \\nAssessment Procedures (FHAP) Level 1 field program is planned in 2003 (Johnston and \\nSlaney 1996). The results of this field program described below will be submitted to the \\nNEB upon finalization. \\n\\nField sampling will begin immediately following ice-off at each of the eight defined crossing \\nsites. A Level 1 FHAP survey will be conducted from a point 100 m upstream to a point 600 \\nm downstream of the ROW. If high quality habitat for regionally significant species occurs \\nwithin this 700 m section, then additional increments of stream will be surveyed to include \\nany necessary shifting of the ROW. In addition to the fish habitat surveys, inventory \\nsampling for fish presence / absence will involve multiple capture methods including \\nelectrofisher, gill nets, seine nets and minnow traps. Timing of this field program is weather \\ndependent and thus may be delayed by snow or ice conditions. \\n\\n13.8.2 Results of Issues Scoping \\n\\n13.8.2.1 Project Effects Analysis \\n\\nAlthough pipeline developments represent narrow, linear disturbances on the landscape; \\npipeline water crossing construction has the potential to cause temporary adverse effects \\non stream and river ecosystems (Reid and Anderson 1999). Potential project effects \\ninclude:  \\n\\n• sedimentation and instream habitat alteration from disturbing (trenching) riparian \\nzone and stream channel \\n\\n• sediment introductions from adjacent disturbed ROW \\n\\n• drainage pattern alteration from ROW development \\n\\n• increased fishing pressure from new access potential \\n\\nHabitat Alteration \\n\\nThe major effects of pipeline developments on streams and associated fisheries resources \\nare generally associated with instream activities during construction. Conventional trenched \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-159\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\ncrossings involve bank and riparian modifications during ROW preparation and instream \\ntrenching for pipe installation, and can result in elevated levels of total suspended solids in \\nthe stream during the construction period. While trenchless techniques such as Horizontal \\nDirectional Drills (HDDs) are now commonly employed to install pipe below channels to \\nreduce instream disturbance, the installation of vehicle crossing structures to accommodate \\nconstruction traffic can still result in some level of disturbance to the bed and banks of the \\nstream, even at drilled crossings.  \\n\\nAn extensive review of the effects of sediments on fish, fish habitat and macroinvertebrates \\nhas been reported in Anderson et al. (1996), Newcombe and Jensen (1996), Newcombe \\n(1994), Newcombe and Macdonald (1991). Riparian and stream habitat alterations within \\nROW’s are discussed in Brown et al. (2000). \\n\\nSediment Introductions \\n\\nDuring and immediately following construction, the newly developed ROW is generally void \\nof vegetative cover, and potentially prone to surface erosion from wind and running water. \\nWhere the ROW encounters long approach slopes to watercourses, sediment laden run-off \\ncan enter the watercourse from the ROW, increasing TSS and downstream sedimentation, \\nand potentially affecting fish habitat quality. \\n\\nAltered Stream Flow Patterns \\n\\nPipeline developments can potentially affect flow rates in streams through: \\n\\n• instream trenching activities during pipe installation \\n\\n• water withdrawals for hydrostatic testing \\n\\n• localized interception and diversion of surface or shallow groundwater flows from \\nditch subsidence along ROW (see Terrain and Soils section of EIA) \\n\\nThese are typically short-term events associated with open trench and construction \\nactivities but nevertheless must be considered in the planning of a pipeline Project. \\n\\nIncreased Access Potential \\n\\nNew ROW developments into previously remote terrain can increase access potential, \\nparticularly for off-road vehicles such as ATVs and snowmobiles. This increase in access \\ncan result in an increase in or redistribution of recreational fishing pressures which, in turn, \\ncan affect sport fish populations. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-160\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.8.2.2 Key Impact Questions \\n\\nThe following table lists the key impact issues that could arise from the various activities \\nassociated with construction and operations of the Pipeline at stream crossings. The \\nprimary potential areas of impacts are associated with the actual crossing sites, while \\nsecondary effects are associated with downstream habitat alteration and access potential. \\n \\n\\nKey Impact Issue Key Impact Questions \\nHabitat alterations from pipe installation and \\ntemporary construction bridges \\n\\nWhat are effects of sedimentation and ROW habitat \\nalterations on fish spawning, rearing, overwintering, \\nfeeding, migration and capacity to produce fish: \\nWhat are the effects of any altered stream flow on \\nabove?  \\n\\nSediment introductions from ROW What are potential sedimentation effects from \\nadjacent disturbed ROWs? \\n\\nAltered stream flow patterns How will the Project effect flow rates, particularly \\nduring low winter flows? \\n\\nNew access potential What is potential of increase recreational fishing? \\n\\n13.8.3 Study Area \\n\\nThe study area for this Project includes the riparian area on either side of the channel for a \\nlinear distance along the stream channel at least equal to the impacted area. The study \\narea is bounded downstream by the transitional zone boundary or reach break for each \\nstream crossing. The downstream reach breaks for this Project are as follows: \\n\\n• Kyklo Creek – confluence with Klicho Creek \\n\\n• Unnamed tributary to Kotcho River – confluence with Kotcho River \\n\\n• Townsoitoi Creek – confluence with Kotcho River \\n\\n• Unnamed tributary #1 to Townsoitoi Creek – confluence with Townsoitoi Creek \\n\\n• Unnamed tributary #2 to Townsoitoi Creek – confluence with Townsoitoi Creek \\n\\n• Hay River – two km downstream of proposed crossing \\n\\n• Unnamed tributary to the Hay River – confluence with the Hay River \\n\\n• Little Hay River – two km downstream of proposed crossing \\n\\n13.8.4 Assessment Scenarios \\n\\nThis assessment addresses impacts associated with construction (winter 2003-2004) and \\noperations (2007 and beyond). Baseline data will be collected in the spring of 2003 to verify \\ndata presented in the baseline setting section (i.e., Section 13.8.1) of this application. The \\n2003 baseline data survey will employ former British Columbia Watershed Restoration \\nProgram Level 1 Fish Habitat Assessment Procedure (FHAP) protocols, coupled with an \\nintensive fish sampling program utilizing multiple collection techniques (i.e., gill and seine \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-161\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nnets, minnow traps and electrofishing if field conditions are within electrofishing guideline \\ncriteria). All sampling will be conducted within the boundaries of the Project study area as \\noutlined in Section 13.8.3. \\n\\n13.8.5 Proposed Mitigation \\n\\nThe detailed fisheries and habitat surveys proposed for the spring period (May 2003) at \\nthese crossings to investigate use and habitat conditions will influence the development of \\nfinal mitigation and crossing design plans for these streams. The information presented in \\nthis section will be modified and further defined as required, once spring surveys have been \\ncompleted.  \\n\\n13.8.5.1 Habitat Alteration \\n\\nThe most effective mitigation for minimizing or eliminating adverse habitat alterations at \\nwatercourses is the development of effective crossing plans. Detailed crossing plans have \\nbeen developed for the major watercourses crossed by this Project, and are presented in \\nthe Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) of this document (see Appendix 13D).  \\n\\nBriefly, horizontal directional drills (HDDs) are proposed for the four named stream \\ncrossings, including Kyklo Creek, Townsoitoi Creek, the Hay River and Little Hay River. \\nBore holes drilled next to these crossing in February 2003 indicated that all four crossings \\nare good candidates for drills, as the drill path will encounter fine-textured fluvial deposits or \\nstiff tills. For all of these crossings, the drill exit and entry points will be located a minimum \\nof 125 m from the channel, ensuring protection for the bed, bank and riparian area of these \\nstreams. In spite of the fact that all of these streams were frozen to the substrates during \\nFebruary 2003, EnCana is committed to drilling these crossings regardless of flows next \\nwinter because of the reduced impacts to bed and banks associated with such crossing \\ntechniques. Should a drill fail at any of these sites, all sites are also suitable for isolated \\ntrenched crossings because of their low winter flows and flat to gently sloping approaches. \\nDetails of these contingency crossing methods are also presented in the EPP.  \\n\\nAll other streams encountered by the ROW are small and/or shallow channels that will \\nundoubtedly be frozen to their substrates during construction. They are considered to have \\nno overwintering value for fish. If standing water is present under the ice at these sites \\nduring construction, isolated trenched crossings will be used. If no standing water is \\npresent, a simple trenched crossing will be employed. \\n\\nPreferred crossing structures for construction traffic have also been developed in the \\ncrossing design plans in the EPP. For the Hay River, a two span bridge has been designed \\nto eliminate bank grading and minimize instream channel disturbance. At all other \\ncrossings, the gentle approaches, low banks and minimal winter flows make these \\ncrossings ideal for simple snow/ice bridges. Clean snow borrowed from adjacent areas or \\nwater will be used to build up the bridge surface at these crossings. If water is drawn from \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-162\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nthe watercourse to construct the bridge, withdrawal rates will be limited to 10 percent of the \\nmeasured flow at the time of construction. \\n\\n13.8.5.2 Sediment Introductions \\n\\nGiven the flat terrain encountered by the Project on approaches to streams, sediment \\nintroductions from the Row will be a minor issue for this Project. Nevertheless, a number of \\nstandard construction and reclamation practices will be undertaken at the discretion of the \\nEnvironmental Inspector to mitigate this potential impact. \\n\\n• should thawed conditions be encountered during construction, temporary erosion \\nand sediment control measures will be implemented to prevent sediment \\nintroductions from the ROW into streams, including the installation of silt fences on \\napproaches to streams \\n\\n• on the shallow approach slopes to Kyklo Creek and the Little Hay River, surface \\ndiversion berms will be installed at strategic intervals during clean-up to divert run-off \\nfrom the ROW into stable, vegetated off-ROW areas \\n\\n• all approach slopes will be seeded immediately following construction with an \\napproved cover crop that will aid in the re-vegetation of suitable and stable plant \\nspecies. A slower developing native revegetation seed mix will be applied at the \\nsame time. \\n\\n13.8.5.3 Altered Stream Flow Patterns \\n\\nThe following measures will be implemented to reduced project-related effects on stream \\nflows: \\n\\n• isolated crossing techniques with pump around features will be used on all streams \\nsupporting flowing water beneath the ice at the time of crossing (with the exception \\nof the HDD crossings) to maintain downstream flows during trenching \\n\\n• all water withdrawals required from streams for ice bridge development or \\nhydrostatic testing will be restricted to 10 percent of calculated stream flows at the \\ntime of construction, unless otherwise directed by federal or provincial authorities \\n\\n• there is potential for ditch subsidence associated with pipeline development in peat-\\ndominated lowland terrain to result in localized interception and diversion of surface \\nand shallow groundwater flows. Measures to maintain natural cross-ROW drainage \\npatterns will be implemented as part of good construction practice, including: \\n\\n• inspection during backfilling operations to ensure that ditchline is adequately \\nbackfilled and roached to accommodate subsequent settlement and reduced \\nditchline subsidence \\n\\n• breaks in elevated backfill at natural drainage channels and strategic intervals to \\nmaintain cross-ROW drainage  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-163\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n• inspection one year after ditchline remediation to correct significant areas of ditch \\nsubsidence, where necessary \\n\\n• installation of mineral soil stub berms over ditchline at strategic locations to \\ndeflect water out of problematic ditchline areas (see Section 13.5, Terrain and \\nSoils for more details)  \\n\\n13.8.5.4 New Access Potential \\n\\nThe naturally wet terrain encountered by the Project will greatly limit the degree of new \\naccess potential afforded by the ROW during periods of non-frozen ground. To limit winter \\naccess, an access management plan (see Appendix 13D.C of the EPP and Appendix 13A, \\nEnvironmental Alignment Sheets) has been developed to limit the degree to which the new \\nROW represents an extension of the existing network of winter access in the area. The \\nplan primarily involves the installation of timber and slash rollback along sections of the \\nROW at intersections with existing winter roads and at access point to the riparian areas of \\nmajor stream channels. While designed primarily to protect long term wildlife habitat values, \\nthe plan will also effectively limit new access to and associated recreation fishing pressures \\non fish bearing streams crossed by the Project. \\n\\n13.8.6 Residual Project Effects \\n\\n13.8.6.1 Analytical Procedures \\n\\nProject effects have been assessed based on similar projects in similar biological settings, \\nbaseline information for the Etsho Management Area, and qualitative assessment of \\ncurrent habitat and fish use at each crossing.  \\n\\nThis qualitative assessment involved: \\n\\n• comparing key habitat attributes within each stream crossing study area with \\nspecies- specific preferred habitat attributes derived from the literature \\n\\n• developing a description of key habitats that may be adversely affected by the \\nProject both from trenching and downstream sediment deposition \\n\\n• evaluating the relative contribution of each action to habitat alteration as a result of \\nthe Project \\n\\nAdditional analysis will be conducted based on the Spring field sampling in 2003 to verify \\nthis initial assessment. The Spring sampling program is outlined in Section 13.8.4.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-164\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.8.7 Results \\n\\n13.8.7.1 Instream Habitat Alterations \\n\\nBased on preliminary investigations, all of the eight defined streams crossed by the Project \\nare considered to support low instream habitat complexity, diversity and capacity (Section \\n13.8.1.2), a trend that is consistent with the region’s low capacity to produce regionally \\nsignificant fish populations. Geotechnical investigations at the crossings in February of \\n2003 found all of the major stream channels to be frozen to their substrates, suggesting \\nthat overwintering potential in the vicinity of the crossing sites is also very limited. In \\naddition, the sediment size of riparian surficial deposits and channel substrate at normal \\nwinter discharge are favourable to quick deposition in a relatively short distance \\ndownstream of each crossing, even if instream activities result in channel disturbance. As \\nwell, all of the streams encountered have meandering characteristics with low gradient \\nprofiles, and are not as susceptible to perpetuating stream headcutting as higher gradient \\nstreams if banks are disturbed by pipeline activities.  \\n\\nThese facts, coupled with the crossing techniques proposed for the Project (i.e., HDDs at \\nthe four named crossings, regardless of winter flows, isolated trenched crossings for all \\nother streams with winter flows) make it reasonable to assume that no important habitat \\ncomponents or overall stream productive capacity will be affected by the Project. This \\nassessment is, of course, subject to the findings of the proposed spring surveys. Therefore, \\nproject effects on instream habitat conditions are currently predicted to be low magnitude \\nevents, as indicated and defined in Table 13.8-2 below. The potential effects of the Project \\nin the event of a failed HDD at one of the four named crossings are assessed under upset \\nevents in Section 13.12 of the EIA. \\n\\n13.8.7.2 Sediment Introductions from ROW \\n\\nAll of the larger named streams meander through level fluvial deposits that are slightly \\nelevated above the surrounding muskeg terrain. Therefore, approaches to the streams are \\nflat, and actual approach slopes to the channels are either short and gradual, or non-\\nexistent. This greatly limits the potential for the ROW to contribute sediments to the stream \\nchannels during its early, non-vegetated state. The mitigation measures proposed for the \\nROW further reduce this potential. Therefore, ROW contributions to stream sedimentation \\nare currently predicted to be low magnitude events, as indicated and defined in \\nTable 13.8-2 below. \\n\\n13.8.7.3 Altered Stream Flow Patterns \\n\\nThere is a high probability that streams encountered by the Project during winter \\nconstruction will not be supporting below ice flows, and that the Project will have no effect \\non flow patterns. If flows are encountered, the proposed HDD crossings and isolated \\ntrenched crossings with pump around options will maintain natural flows throughout \\nconstruction.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-165\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nOn the longer term, ROW effects on localized surface and shallow subsurface drainage \\npatterns into streams are expected to be minimal with the proposed mitigation. The fact that \\nthe ROW is generally aligned at right angles to stream channels close to the crossing sites \\nfurther reduces its potential to intercept measurable contributing inflows into fish-bearing \\nstreams in the area.  \\n\\nEffects on flows are most likely to be realized through water withdrawals for hydrostatic \\ntesting or ice bridge construction. Any approved water withdrawals from streams will \\ncomply with federal and/or provincial permitting restrictions, and will typically take \\n10 percent or less of existing flows to protect any local fisheries resources. However, there \\nis the potential for minor shifts in fish distribution in reaches affected by withdrawals. \\nTherefore, largely as the result of water withdrawals, project contributions to altered stream \\nflow are currently predicted to be medium magnitude, short term (if they occur), reversible \\nevents, as indicated and defined in Table 13.8-2 below.  \\n\\n13.8.7.4 New Access Potential \\n\\nHabitat within the study area appears to be under-utilized by regionally significant fish \\npopulations, a condition that does not encourage a high rate of exploitation or fishing \\ninterest, and winter fishing opportunities in streams crossed by the Project are negligible. \\nNo permanent access roads are proposed to be constructed to support construction or \\nmaintenance of the line, and all bridges will be removed following construction as well as \\ncorduroy material used to stabilize temporary winter roads. Furthermore, new winter access \\npotential along the ROW will be further curtailed with access management initiatives \\nidentified in the mitigation section above. Accordingly, the ROW is not expected to \\nmeasurably contribute to new access potential or increased fishing pressures after \\nconstruction. \\n\\n13.8.7.5 Summary \\n\\nEffects on instream habitat, sediment levels and access potential are low in magnitude and \\nextent, short term in duration and reversible and do not have potential to measurably \\ncontribute to cumulative effects. Only one potential effect is considered to be of moderate \\nmagnitude: altered stream flows during construction.  However, this potential effect is \\npredicted to be short term in duration and reversible, and will not have potential to \\ncontribute to cumulative effects. \\n\\nTable 13.8-2 summarizes the predicted impacts assessments above, using impact \\ndescriptors as defined in the table footnotes below. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-166\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nTable 13.8-2 Summary of Project Effects for Fisheries and Aquatic Resources \\n\\nAssessment \\nScenario \\n\\nIssue/Measurable \\nParameter \\n\\nMagnitude/ \\nExtent1 Duration2 \\n\\nReversible/ \\nNon-\\n\\nReversible3 \\n\\nPotential for \\nMeasurable \\n\\nContribution to \\nCumulative \\n\\nEffects4 \\nAltered Instream \\nHabitat \\n\\nLow Short-term Reversible no \\n\\nSediment \\nIntroductions \\n\\nLow Short-term Reversible no \\n\\nAltered stream \\nflows \\n\\nModerate Short-term Reversible no \\n\\nConstruction \\n\\nNew Access \\nPotential \\n\\nLow Short-term Reversible no \\n\\nSediment \\nIntroductions \\n\\nLow Short-term Reversible no Operations \\n\\nNew Access \\nPotential \\n\\nLow Long-term Reversible no \\n\\nNotes: 1 Magnitude/Extent – refers to the degree of change (or risk) to biodiversity \\nLow – change in measurable parameter will have no effect on local species abundance and diversity \\n\\n(stream productive capacity) (i.e., within 2 km mapped corridor) \\nModerate –  change in measurable parameter will have possible effect on local species abundance \\n\\nand diversity (stream productive capacity) (i.e., within 2 km mapped corridor) \\nHigh – possible measurable effect on species abundance and diversity (stream productive capacity) \\n\\nwithin Etsho Resource Management Zone \\n2 Duration – refers to the length of time over which the project-related effect is measurable \\nShort term – less than 1 year \\nMedium term – greater than 1 year but not beyond life of project \\nLong term – beyond life of project \\n3 Reversibility/Non-reversibility – refers to the potential for conditions to return to baseline \\n\\nconditions, in the absence of the project \\nReversible – will likely revert to baseline conditions following end of project life or before \\nNon-reversible – unlikely to revert to baseline conditions following end of project life \\n4 Potential for Measurable Contribution to Cumulative Effects \\nYes – measurable contribution to CE within Etsho Resource Management Zone(generally requires \\n\\nhigh magnitude and medium to long-term impact on species) \\nNo – no measurable contribution to CE within Etsho Resource Management Zone  \\n\\n13.8.8 Cumulative Effects Implications \\n\\n13.8.8.1 Combined Project Effects \\n\\nThe four main Project impacts that could combine to influence fisheries resources (in more \\ndiverse systems) are potential instream habitat alteration, sedimentation, water withdrawal \\nand new access potential. The assessment has indicated that each of these effects will \\nhave a minimal influence on fish abundance/diversity or stream productive capacity, and no \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-167\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nlocalized effects are expected to extend past the construction period. Consequently, the \\ncombined effects are considered insignificant. \\n\\n13.8.8.2 Project Contribution to Regional Cumulative Effects \\n\\nA number of other projects unrelated to the Ekwan pipeline are active in the Project area, \\nand some are directly or indirectly interacting with streams crossed by the Ekwan Project. \\nFor example, an ice bridge is generally installed on the Little Hay River in support of an oil \\ndevelopment near the B.C./Alberta border in the same general location as the proposed \\npipeline crossing, presenting the possibility of cumulative effects. However, the assessment \\nfor this Project has indicated that measurable effects from the Project are unlikely within the \\n2 km-wide study corridor. Consequently, the Project is not expected to contribute to \\ncumulative effects either locally or at a broader regional level, and no further analysis is \\nconsidered warranted. \\n\\n13.8.9 Follow-up and Monitoring \\n\\nDuring construction, downstream water flow and/or total suspended solids will be monitored \\nfor all HDD and isolated trenched crossings, provided standing water is present under the \\nice at the time of construction. \\n\\nPost-construction monitoring is not anticipated for fisheries or fisheries habitat under the \\ncurrent crossing design proposals. Should contingency isolated crossing techniques be \\nrequired on any of the four named streams, then assessments of bed and bank stability \\nand riparian zone recovery will be made at the end of the first growing season after \\nconstruction. Depending on the findings at that time, monitoring may be extended into a \\nsecond year to adequately track outstanding issues. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-168\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.9 Land and Resource Use \\n\\n13.9.1 Baseline Setting \\n\\nThe proposed Project is located within the Northern Rockies Regional District of British \\nColumbia and the Municipal District of Mackenzie No. 23 in Alberta. More specifically, the \\nPipeline traverses approximately 78 km of the Fort Nelson Forest District in British \\nColumbia and about 5 km of the Upper Hay Rainbow Forest Area in Alberta.  \\n\\nApproximately 76 percent of the proposed route have been previously disturbed as a result \\nof seismic lines and pipelines. The lands traversed are inhabited by white spruce-lodge \\npole pine, white spruce-balsam poplar riparian, black spruce, bog and sphagnum bogs with \\nwetland types dominating the eastern two-thirds of the proposed route.  \\n\\nLand and resource use activities encountered within the Project area include trapping, \\ntraditional hunting, guide outfitting, oil and gas exploration and development. A protected \\narea is also found near the Project area. Within the study region other land and resource \\nuses include commercial timber harvesting, consumptive (sport hunting and fishing) and \\nnon-consumptive recreation (snowmobiling). \\n\\n13.9.1.1 Trapping \\n\\nThe land traversed by the Project is located within the traditional territories of the Fort \\nNelson First Nation (FNFN) and the Dene Tha’ First Nation (DTFN). The two traditional \\nterritories overlap one another in British Columbia. Trapping is socially, culturally and \\neconomically important to the two First Nations. Within these two overlapping territories are \\nfive designated trapping areas in British Columbia and one in Alberta that could be affected \\nby the Project. The designated trapping areas are: \\n\\nBC Trapline Territory 756-T013 (1 FNFN trapper) \\n\\nBC Trapline Territory 756-T009 (in trust to FNFN, number of trappers varies each year) \\n\\nBC Trapline Territory 756-T003 (3 FNFN trappers)  \\n\\nBC Trapline Territory 756-T002 (4 FNFN trappers) \\n\\nBC Trapline Territory 756-T001 (14 DTFN trappers) \\n\\nAlberta Registered Trapping Area 88 (24 DTFN trappers) \\n\\nThe land surrounding the Project area in British Columbia and Alberta provides habitat for a \\nvariety of commercially harvested furbearers including beaver, muskrat, lynx, marten, mink, \\nweasel, red squirrel, coyote, fisher, red fox and wolverine (British Columbia Ministry of \\nWater, Lands and Air Protection  Alberta Sustainable Resource Development 2002). The \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-169\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nspecies harvested in the greatest numbers within these trapping areas are beaver, lynx, \\nmarten and red squirrel (Alberta Sustainable Resource Development 2002b; Capot Blanc \\n2002, pers. comm.; McCarthy , pers. comm.; J.B. Tally 2003, pers. comm.; T. Tally 2003, \\npers. comm.). Species harvested with less frequency include the muskrat, weasel, red fox \\nand mink (British Columbia Ministry of Water, Lands and Air Protection 2003b; Alberta \\nSustainable Resource Development 2002b).  \\n\\nIn addition to the monetary value of the harvested furbearers, the beaver, muskrat, and in \\nsome instances lynx, are consumed as food by the trappers and their families. \\nFurthermore, the trappers and other members of their families hunt moose and woodland \\ncaribou within the designated trapping areas throughout the year (Capot Blanc 2002, pers. \\ncomm.; McCarthy 2002, pers. comm.; J.B. Tally 2003, pers. comm.; T. Tally 2003, pers. \\ncomm.). \\n\\n13.9.1.2 Guide Outfitting \\n\\nIn British Columbia, the Project is located within Wildlife Management Unit (WMU) 7-56 \\nwhere several big game species reside including moose, woodland caribou, mule deer, \\ngrizzly bear and black bear. However, there is no guide outfitter assigned to WMU 7-56 due \\nto the extensive wetlands and muskeg in the area and limited access to and within the area \\nwhen the ground is not frozen (Damant 2002, pers. comm.). \\n\\nIn Alberta, the Project is located WMU 536. In this area, wetlands are less prevalent and \\nground access is better than the British Columbia portion of the Project area. Twelve guide \\noutfitters hold big game allocations in WMU 536 that enables them to take non-resident \\nhunters on guided hunts for black bear, mule deer, moose and white tailed deer. \\nApproximately 60 percent of the allocations are for black bear hunting (Alberta Professional \\nOutfitters Society 2003). \\n\\n13.9.1.3 Oil and Gas Exploration and Development \\n\\nOn the British Columbia portion of the Project, the EnCana Oil and Gas Partnership \\n(including Amber Energy/AEC Oil and Gas) and Nexen Canada (including Wascana \\nEnergy) have extensive natural gas and oil holdings and development activities. EnCana’s \\noil and gas infrastructure along the proposed pipeline corridor includes:  \\n\\n• Approximately 20,000 km of seismic lines - average cut line width 5.5 m \\n\\n• 92 well sites – average lease size 130 m x 130 m \\n\\n• 175 km of flow lines – average width of ROW is 15 m \\n\\n• 1 gas plant at Sierra (a-26-K/94-I-11) – size 250 m x 250 m, 3.53 x 1012 m3 capacity \\n\\nFurther east Nexen Canada has intensive oil exploration and development near the British \\nColumbia/Alberta border. The Nexen holdings are primarily oil but it also has some natural \\ngas. Currently Nexen produces approximately 1400 m3/day (8800 BBL/day) of oil from a \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-170\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nseries of production pads and batteries. The oil is transported via a 38 km 203 mm (8 inch) \\npipeline to a tie-in with the Husky oil pipeline in the area. The inventory of Nexen \\ninfrastructure includes: \\n\\n• 14 production pads with 8 horizontal wells/pad – spaced 90 m apart with an average \\npad size 120 m x 150 m \\n\\n• 2 water pad sites \\n\\n• 2 gas wells – 50 m x 50 m each \\n\\n• 50 vertical oil wells – 50 m x 50 m each \\n\\n• 30 km of power line/pipeline/winter road corridor \\n\\nThe winter road is usable three months of the year. Access to and around the oil production \\nfacilities during the rest of the year is via helicopter and all terrain vehicles (Siemens 2003, \\npers. comm.). \\n\\nNexen has minor land holdings near the Project in Alberta but there are no development \\nplans in the foreseeable future. Both Nexen and ConocoPhillips, who formerly held oil and \\ngas leases adjacent to the Project in Alberta, have licenses of occupation (LOCs) for \\naccess roads in the vicinity of the proposed pipeline. The Nexen’s LOC represents part of \\nthe winter road access to its oil production facilities in British Columbia (Currie 2003, pers. \\ncomm.; Siemens 2003, pers. comm.). \\n\\n13.9.1.4 Parks, Protected Areas and Environmentally Sensitive Areas \\n\\nThe Project is not located in or adjacent to lands designated or proposed as a provincial or \\nregional park, conservation area or recreation area. Further, no protected areas are \\ntraversed. The Project falls primarily within the Etsho RMZ, an enhanced resource \\ndevelopment zone identified within the Fort Nelson Land and Resource Management Plan. \\nIt also crosses the Petitot/Hay River Corridors RMZ which poses no real impediment to \\ndevelopment. The closest protected area to the proposed pipeline alignment is the Hay \\nRiver Protected Area, whose southern boundary is less than two kilometres north of the \\nPipeline (Fort Nelson LRMP Working Group 1997).  \\n\\nThe Hay River Protected Area is a Goal Two protected area category resource. The \\nreasons for protection status include: \\n\\n• ecosection representation of the Fort Nelson Lowlands \\n\\n• historical use by Wood Bison and First Nations people \\n\\n• an outstanding example of river meadows with associated wildlife values \\n\\nDirectional drilling for petroleum and natural gas with no surface access is permitted. New \\noil and gas tenures are permitted in these areas subject to review every ten years (Fort \\nNelson LRMP Working Group 1997). \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-171\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nThe area encompasses 2,000 ha and is accessible via winter road or by aircraft with good \\nfishing potential for northern pike, walleye, burbot and trout perch. \\n\\nThe general area has traditionally been used by the Slavey, Cree and Beaver cultures of \\nthe FNFN, DTFN and Fort Laird First Nations. It was identified as a protected area in the \\nFort Nelson Land and Resource Management Plan in 1997. \\n\\n13.9.1.5 Commercial Timber Harvesting \\n\\nThe proposed Project is located in the Fort Nelson Forest District in British Columbia and \\nthe F14 Timber Quota Area of the Upper Hay/Rainbow Forest in Alberta. In British \\nColumbia, the Project does not pass through any commercial timber harvesting areas \\n(Thomas 2003, pers. comm.). However, three to four kilometres north of the Kotcho River \\ncrossing, Slocan Forest Products has a number of existing and proposed cut blocks. \\nSlocan holds a volume based commercial timber harvesting license that allows it to harvest \\nup to 1.3 million cubic feet of aspen and coniferous timber each year for their oriented \\nstrand board plant and sawmill/plywood mill operations in Fort Nelson. Three cut blocks \\nnorth of the Kotcho River were harvested over the past two winters and two other \\ndesignated blocks in this area are scheduled for harvesting sometime between 2008 and \\n2013. The Project would not affect either of the these future blocks (Kuhn 2003, pers. \\ncomm.).  \\n\\nIn Alberta, the Project extends approximately five kilometres into F14 Timber Quota Area. \\nThere is no existing or planned timber harvesting in close proximity to the Project during the \\nforeseeable future (Norris 2003, pers. comm.). However, two sawmills in High Level are \\ntentatively planning to harvest coniferous and deciduous timber in an area located about \\nfive kilometres north of the Pipeline alignment in 2006-07 (Jenkins 2003, pers. comm.). In \\naddition, Tolko Industries at High Level has a Forest Management Agreement (FMA) that \\nencompasses land to the north, east and south of the Project in Alberta, but at its closest \\npoint the FMA is 15 km away (Jenkins 2003, pers. comm.).  \\n\\n13.9.1.6 Consumptive and Non-Consumptive Outdoor Recreation \\n\\nConsumptive recreational activities in the British Columbia and Alberta regions where the \\nProject is located include sport hunting and fishing. Non-consumptive recreation activity is \\nprimarily snowmobiling during the winter months when the ground is frozen. In British \\nColumbia, sport hunting and fishing in WMU 7-56 in general, and the Project area in \\nparticular, are thought to be minimal due the abundance of wetlands and muskeg, the \\ndistance from urban centres, and limited permanent and seasonal access to the area \\n(Webster 2003, pers. comm.). Some moose, black bear, cougar, wolves, spruce grouse, \\nruffled grouse and sharp-tailed grouse are hunted within this WMU (Thornton 2003, pers. \\ncomm.). Hunting seasons for most of these species occur between mid-August and mid-\\nNovember or April to June when ground access is very difficult due to a lack of roads and \\nthe abundance of muskeg and wetlands (British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air \\nProtection 2002).  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-172\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nThe Alberta portion of the Project is located in WMU 536 where moose, mule deer, white-\\ntail deer, and black bear are harvested by sport hunters. Hunting seasons for these species \\nare largely confined to the month of August. The exception is black bear, which can be \\nhunted from mid-April to mid-July and the last week of August. Game birds hunted within \\nthe Project area include: ruffed and spruce grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, ptarmigan, ducks, \\nand the Canada, white-fronted, snow and Ross geese. These game birds are hunted \\nduring the period from early September to mid-December (Alberta Sustainable Resource \\nDevelopment 2002b). Wetlands are also prevalent in the Alberta Project area and ground \\naccess is limited and difficult when the ground is not frozen.  \\n\\nIn British Columbia the Project traverses the Hay River and three creeks (Kyklo, Kotcho, \\nTownsoitoi) and in Alberta the Pipeline crosses the Little Hay River. Due to its size and \\nprotected area designation in the Fort Nelson Land and Resource Use Plan, there is some \\nfisheries information available for the Hay River. It is known to support northern pike, \\nwalleye, inconnu, arctic grayling, whitefish, perch, white and long nose sucker. Very little \\ninformation is available for Kyklo Creek, Kotcho River, Townsoitoi Creek and the Little Hay \\nRiver in Alberta. The Alberta sport fishing regulations indicate that tributaries of the Hay \\nRiver, including the Little Hay River, in the Northern Boreal Zone 3 Watershed Unit may \\ncontain arctic grayling, walleye and burbot that can be fished from June 1 to October 31 \\n(Alberta Sustainable Resource Development 2002a). Aerial reconnaissance of the Pipeline \\nalignment in British Columbia indicates that the Kyklo, Kotcho and Townsoitoi Creeks could \\nsupport four or five fish species but very little information is available for these \\nwatercourses and they are not identified in the British Columbia sport fishing regulations for \\nthe Peace Region 7B (Bryden 2003, pers. comm.; British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land \\nand Air Protection 2002). \\n\\nThe proposed Project is located entirely within a portion of the Hay River watershed (Fort \\nNelson Lowlands) that is characterized by poorly drained muskeg lowlands, providing a \\nmosaic of forest and wetland ecosystems. Streams generally have low fish habitat diversity \\nand capacity. Fish biodiversity in the British Columbia portion of the Hay River is low, with \\nonly nine species (six non-game or forage species and three game species) ever recorded. \\nThe three recorded game fish species include walleye, northern pike and burbot but all are \\nsporadic in occurrence and only northern pike may be present in sufficient numbers to \\nsupport a recreational fishery. The other two named creeks traversed in British Columbia \\n(Kyklo and Townsoitoi) contain habitat that appears to be suitable for northern pike \\nspawning and rearing (see Section 13.8). In Alberta the Little Hay appears to have the \\nhabitat diversity and capacity to support walleye, northern pike and burbot. However, in the \\nvicinity of the proposed pipeline crossing there appears to be suitable habitat for over \\nwintering burbot but not suitable habitat for summer rearing of walleye and northern pike \\n(see Section 13.8). \\n\\nThe lack of information on fish habitat and game fisheries in the Project area in British \\nColumbia and Alberta is partially attributed to the isolation of the area, prevalence of \\nmuskeg and wetlands, limited access, and better sport fishing opportunities closer to \\ncommunities in the region. Taking into account these limitations and recognizing that \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-173\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nindustrial activity in this area is confined to winter months when the ground and \\nwatercourses are frozen, it is speculated that the occurrence of recreational fishing in the \\nProject area in British Columbia and Alberta is low. \\n\\nLimited ground access and the abundance of wetlands and muskeg in the Project area in \\nBritish Columbia and Alberta severely limits non-consumptive recreation opportunities in \\nthe area. There is evidence of snowmobiling in the Project area during the winter months. \\nHowever, the snowmobiling could be attributed as much to industrial activity in the area as \\nit could to recreation activity for camp occupants (Backmeyer 2003, pers. comm.)  \\n\\n13.9.2 Results of Issue Scoping \\n\\nIssue scoping of land and resource use was undertaken using the following process: \\n\\n• review of all land and resource disposition holders on the proposed pipeline route \\n\\n• contacts with the Fort Nelson First Nation and Dene Tha’ First Nation that have \\noverlapping traditional territories that could be affected by the Project \\n\\n• contact with trappers assigned to designated trapping areas that would be traversed \\nby the Project \\n\\n• contact with guide outfitters with wildlife allocations in the Project area \\n\\n• contact with petroleum companies with oil and gas leases and development \\ninfrastructure in close proximity to the Project \\n\\n• contact with commercial timber harvesting companies in the Project area \\n\\n• contact with government agencies responsible for forest management, land and \\nresource use in the Project area \\n\\n• contact with wildlife biologists on the environmental impact assessment team \\nconcerning potential effects on wildlife in the Project area \\n\\nA chronological list of these contacts is provided in Section 11 of the EnCana Ekwan \\nPipeline application. \\n\\nThe proposed Project may affect wildlife during construction and operations phases. The \\neffects on wildlife could occur due to clearing and Pipeline operation activities and \\nincreased access. The disturbance associated with development activities of the Pipeline \\nrights-of-way (ROW) may affect wildlife both over the short-term and long-term. Over most \\nof the Pipeline route where existing ROW (pipeline and seismic line) will be paralleled, the \\nimpacts on wildlife resulting from the Project are expected to be minimal in terms of \\nreduced habitat availability and fragmentation, and will likely have little potential for \\naffecting wildlife resources locally and regionally. Greater impacts on wildlife could occur in \\nareas of new ROW development, but new ROW is limited to approximately 19 km or \\n23 percent of the Pipeline route. Potential effects in the areas of new ROW will be \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-174\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nminimized through a combination of route selection, timing of construction, and through \\nimplementation of site specific mitigation measures (e.g., access control). \\n\\nProject-related effects on wildlife could also affect trapping, traditional hunting, guide \\noutfitting and sport hunting because all of these activities are directly linked to the local and \\nregional availability and abundance of wildlife. However, route selection, timing of \\nconstruction and implementation of site specific mitigation measures including access \\ncontrol, can effectively mitigate potential adverse effects on these resource uses. \\n\\nThe EnCana Oil and Gas Partnership and Nexen Canada have petroleum leases and \\ndevelopment infrastructure in proximity to the Project. While the Project is complimentary to \\nEnCana’s existing activities in the area, it could potentially disrupt those of Nexen Canada. \\nHowever, a combination of routing selection and site specific measures (e.g. depth of \\ncover) could effectively mitigate any potential Nexen issues.  \\n\\nNo parks, protected areas or commercial timber harvesting is encountered on the Pipeline \\nroute but the Hay River Protected Area is located within two kilometres of the proposed \\nPipeline route. Petroleum and natural gas exploration, logging, trapping, sport hunting and \\nfishing and off-highway vehicle use are all deemed acceptable land and resource uses in \\nthe Project area (Fort Nelson LRMP 1997). However, because the region has experienced \\nhigh levels of multiple land use developments, specific Project effects may interact in a \\ncumulative manner with existing and future land use pressures. As a result, this \\nassessment, while addressing the localized effects of the Project, also considered \\ncumulative effects, where the Project was identified to potentially contribute to cumulative \\neffects. \\n\\n13.9.2.1 Project Effects Analysis \\n\\nPotential effects on land and resource use from the proposed Project may occur from \\nindividual or combined effects of: \\n\\n• reduced wildlife habitat availability \\n\\n• blockage of wildlife movement \\n\\n• direct and indirect wildlife mortalities \\n\\n• disruption of petroleum development activities \\n\\n• loss of merchantable timber \\n\\nThe following discussion summarizes these project-specific effects of the Pipeline on land \\nand resource use.  \\n\\n13.9.2.1.1 Reduced Wildlife Habitat Availability \\n\\nFor pipelines, highly localized habitat loss occurs at permanent above-ground facilities \\n(valve assemblies), while habitat alteration occurs along the ROW or in temporary \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-175\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nworkspace where native vegetation is removed and replaced through reclamation efforts \\n(see Section 13.7 for details). Of specific concern would be the potential loss through \\nconstruction activities of an important localized habitat feature for a special status species. \\n\\nHabitat availability can also be indirectly influenced by zones of sensory disturbance \\nadjacent to physically altered areas created by human activities, where habitats become \\nless attractive to wildlife because of increased disturbance or mortality risk. In addition, \\nhabitat availability can also be influenced through habitat fragmentation by a pipeline \\nROWs if/when it is of sufficient width to discourage crossing by wildlife (see Section 13.7). \\n\\n13.9.2.1.2 Blockage of Wildlife Movement \\n\\nSeasonal or daily movements of wildlife may be blocked or disrupted as a result of \\nconstruction activities and, more specifically, the presence of vehicles and construction \\npersonnel in and around a pipeline development area. However, given the paralleling and \\nsharing of workspace with existing ROWs for this Project, the short duration of activities in \\nlocalized areas, the winter construction season when few animals are moving large \\ndistances, and mitigation measures to ensure passage of wildlife (see Section 13.7), the \\npotential for wildlife movements to be significantly disrupted as a result of the Project is \\nremote. \\n\\n13.9.2.1.3 Direct and Indirect Wildlife Mortality \\n\\nThe Pipeline development could result in direct wildlife mortalities through collisions with \\nproject vehicles and unrestricted use of firearms by construction personnel. The new \\naccess afforded by pipeline ROWs can also increase the risk of hunting related mortalities \\nand poaching of some species of wildlife. Further, direct and indirect mortality of wildlife \\ncould adversely affect trapping and traditional hunting but mitigation is possible.  \\n\\n13.9.2.1.4 Disruption of Petroleum Development \\n\\nNexen Canada operates an oilfield located next to the proposed Pipeline route and Nexen’s \\nongoing development activities and infrastructure could be disrupted as a result of the \\nproposed Ekwan Pipeline. Specifically, the Pipeline route may traverse two or three winter \\nroads that provide access to and within the oilfield. In addition, the Pipeline construction \\ncould potentially disrupt future development within the oilfield during the winter of \\n2003/2004.  \\n\\n13.9.2.1.5 Loss of Merchantable Timber \\n\\nThe proposed Pipeline route does not pass through any designated commercial timber \\nharvesting areas in British Columbia or Alberta, but it is estimated that less than 2000 M3 of \\nmerchantable coniferous and deciduous timber could be removed during clearing of the \\nPipeline ROW, valve sites and temporary work space. The provincial forest management \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-176\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nagencies have indicated that all merchantable timber logged during Project construction \\nshould be salvaged.  \\n\\n13.9.2.2 Key Impact Questions \\n\\nBased on the discussion above, the following key questions will be the focus of the land \\nand resource use component of the subsequent impact assessment. \\n \\n\\nKey Impact Issue Assessment Approach \\nHow will the Project affect habitat availability for \\nwildlife? \\n\\nQuantitative assessment of changes to high quality \\nhabitat within the mapped 2 km wide study corridor, \\nincorporating disturbance levels of linear corridors \\n(from Section 13.7). \\n\\nHow will the Project indirectly affect wildlife mortality \\nrisk? \\n\\nQuantitative assessment of fragmentation effects on \\ncore security habitat for landscape level species \\nwithin the 30 km wide study corridor, incorporating \\ndisturbance levels of linear corridors. (from Section \\n13.7) \\n\\nHow will the Project directly affect wildlife mortality \\nrisk? \\n\\nQualitative discussion of potential mortality of wildlife \\nspecies of concern along the route due to collisions \\nwith project vehicles, and unrestricted use of firearms \\nby project personnel (from Section 13.7). \\n\\nHow will Project effects on wildlife habitat availability \\nand direct/indirect wildlife mortality risk affect \\ntrapping, traditional hunting, and guide outfitting \\nhunting ? \\n\\nFrom qualitative and quantitative assessment in \\nSection 13.7 and qualitative information provided by \\naffected trappers, guide outfitters and provincial \\nwildlife management agencies.  \\n\\nHow will the Project affect Nexen’s oilfield \\ndevelopment activities? \\n\\nQuantitative assessment of issues and mitigation \\nbased on input received from Nexen, EnCana and \\nproject engineers \\n\\nHow will merchantable timber logged during Pipeline \\nconstruction be disposed of? \\n\\nQuantitative assessment of merchantable timber \\nstands and information supplied by regional timber \\nmanufacturing industry  \\n\\n13.9.3 Study Areas \\n\\nDue to the dependence of much of the land and resource use assessment on the results of \\nthe wildlife assessment, the wildlife study areas are used in this section. For the purposes \\nof this section, the land and resource use LSA and RSA equate to the Project corridor and \\ncore security study area, respectively, in the wildlife section \\n\\nThe local study area (LSA) was defined as a 2 km-wide corridor along the preferred \\nPipeline route (Figure 13.7-1). The LSA was used to describe existing land and resource \\nuses including trapping and traditional hunting, protected areas and petroleum \\ndevelopment that could be directly affected by localized, project-specific effects.  \\n\\nThe regional study area (RSA) was defined as a 30 km wide corridor along the preferred \\nPipeline route (Figure 13.7-1). The RSA reflected the general project setting and described \\nland and resource use that could be indirectly affected (timber harvesting, guide outfitting, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-177\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nconsumptive and non consumptive recreation) by the project or cumulatively affected \\n(wildlife) as a result of pressures over and above that found in the LSA. \\n\\n13.9.4 Assessment Scenarios \\n\\nTo assess Project effects on land and resource use the following assessment periods were \\nused:  \\n\\nBaseline – this represents the existing condition of the land base and resource use under \\ncurrent baseline conditions (early February, 2003).  \\n\\nConstruction – this represents the predicted condition of the land base and resource use \\nat the time of construction (December 2003 to March 2004). By comparing construction to \\nbaseline conditions, the effects of construction activities on land and resource use, as well \\nas those associated with other new (i.e., since baseline) unrelated activities within the study \\ncorridor, can be tracked from baseline conditions.  \\n\\nOperations - this represents the predicted condition of the land base and resource use \\nduring Operations (up to 25 years into the future from baseline). By comparing operations \\nto baseline conditions, the effects of operational activities on land and resource use, as well \\nas those associated with other new (i.e., since Baseline) unrelated activities within the \\nstudy corridor, can be tracked from Baseline conditions. \\n\\nA qualitative discussion on the implications of Project abandonment on land and resource \\nuse is also presented. \\n\\n13.9.5 Proposed Mitigation \\n\\nThe following site-specific mitigation measures and general measures will be \\nrecommended as part of best available practices and have been factored into the \\nassessment of residual effects on land and resource use. However, most of the site-\\nspecific mitigation details to be implemented by the Project to reduce impacts to wildlife will \\nbe developed after detailed wildlife habitat surveys are completed. \\n berms, doglegs, and slash rollback along new ROW for access control \\n avoidance of localized important habitats \\n prohibiting hunting and trapping by construction workers while on the job and residing in \\n\\ncamps in the Project area \\n\\n• directional drills at major creek crossings to limit the clearing of valuable wildlife \\nhabitat in riparian corridors and eliminate adverse effects on fish habitat \\n\\n• avoidance of sensitive wildlife seasons for clearing and construction activities \\n\\n• advance notification of Project construction schedule and Pipeline route to \\npotentially affected trappers and guide outfitters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-178\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n• routing deviations, road use/maintenance agreements, boring under winter roads, \\npipe coating and increased ground cover at and near Nexen Canada’s oilfield \\n\\n• salvage of merchantable timber from the Pipeline ROW and temporary work space \\n\\nClearing and development of the proposed ROW poses the risk of creating new access. \\nAccess proliferation is an important issue concerning caribou due to potential for access-\\ninduced mortalities from both humans and natural predators. Mitigation of the risks of \\nmortality during construction or associated with operational personnel and activity can \\nfocus on timing and implementation of personnel codes of conduct (prohibiting hunting and \\ntrapping), whereas mortality risk associated with public access and natural predator activity \\nmust focus on curtailing the accessibility and use of the new ROW.  \\n\\nAll critical wildlife features (dens, mineral licks) will be avoided by the Project through \\nrouting modifications, unless such modifications represent unacceptable risks or constraints \\nto the Project. Where routing modifications are not possible, EnCana will provide a detailed \\nalternative mitigation plan for the protection of such resources. \\n\\nExtra workspace will not be developed where critical wildlife features are encountered by \\nthe ROW, unless such restrictions represent unacceptable risks or constraints to the \\nProject. \\n\\nFor all wildlife species of concern, mitigation of potential direct project-related mortalities is \\nfocused on selection of timing windows for clearing that are outside vulnerable periods for \\nwildlife and by implementing procedures that control the activities of project personnel and \\nthe general public that may lead to wildlife mortalities. Potential toxicity to wildlife due to \\nhazardous materials spills will be mitigated by spill prevention and contingency response \\nmeasures detailed in the EPP (Appendix 13D). \\n\\nImplementation of these measures will minimize adverse effects on trappers and traditional \\nhunters who depend on the wildlife resources in the LSA and RSA as a source of country \\nfood and income supplement. These wildlife protection measures will also benefit guide \\noutfitters in Alberta. \\n\\nGiven that Nexen’s oilfield operations are located next to the proposed Pipeline route and \\ntheir ongoing development and production activities and infrastructure could be disrupted \\nas a result of the proposed Ekwan Pipeline, a combination of mitigation measures may be \\nimplemented to minimize any adverse effects that could arise. Potential mitigation \\nmeasures include: rerouting the Pipeline to reduce or eliminate access issues, road use \\nand/or road maintenance agreements with Nexen, boring under winter roads instead of \\nopen cut, and increase depth of cover and pipe coating where winter road crossing(s) \\ncannot be avoided.  \\n\\nAlthough no commercial timber harvesting operations are encountered along the Pipeline \\nroute, some merchantable coniferous and deciduous timber will be removed during clearing \\nof the Pipeline ROW and valve sites. Provincial government agencies responsible for forest \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-179\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nmanagement and sustainability in British Columbia and Alberta have indicated that the \\nmerchantable timber must be salvaged for the forest products manufacturing industry in the \\nregions. There are regional sawmills and wood fibre plants in both British Columbia and \\nAlberta. \\n\\n13.9.6 Residual Project Effects \\n\\n13.9.6.1 Analytical Procedures \\n\\nQuantitative and qualitative tools were used to measure project-specific effects for wildlife \\nspecies of concern. Specifically, habitat analysis and core security habitat were used to \\nanalyze and evaluate project and cumulative environmental effects. Details on these two \\nanalytical techniques are provided in Section 13.7 and Appendix 13H-2  \\n\\nThree types of residual impacts (effects that remain after mitigation) through which Pipeline \\nconstruction and operation can affect wildlife populations are reduced habitat availability, \\nincreased direct mortality risk, or indirect mortality risk. Project-specific effects on wildlife \\nfrom these residual impacts were evaluated and described in Section 13.7 using three \\nimpact attributes: magnitude/extent, duration, and reversibility (see Table 13.7-2). These \\nattributes assisted in determining the potential for project-specific impacts to contribute to \\ncumulative effects. \\n\\nThe results of this analysis of project-specific effects for wildlife species of concern \\nprovided a basis for the determination of project-related effects on trapping, traditional \\nhunting and guide outfitting. Because these resource uses rely on some wildlife species of \\nconcern, the results of wildlife assessment helped to validate residual effects on these \\nresource uses. \\n\\n13.9.6.2 Results \\n\\nPotential effects on land and resource use are all predicted to be low in magnitude, with the \\nexception of the potential effects on merchantable timber which is predicted to be \\nmoderate.  Effects on merchantable timber are predicted to be long in duration but be \\nreversible and do not have the potential to contribute measurably to cumulative effects.  \\nOther potential effects range from short to long in duration, but are all considered to be \\nreversible and will not contribute measurably to cumulative effects. Table 13.9-1 presents a \\nsummary of findings for key issues. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-180\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nTable 13.9-1 Summary of Project Effects for Land and Resource Use \\n\\nAssessment \\nScenario Issue \\n\\nMagnitude/ \\nExtent1 Duration2 \\n\\nReversible/ \\nNon-\\n\\nReversible3 \\n\\nPotential for \\nMeasurable \\nContribution \\n\\nto Cumulative \\nEffects4 \\n\\nEffects on furbearer habitat \\nand mortality  \\n\\nLow Short to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible No \\n\\nEffects on trapper harvest \\nand income \\n\\nLow Short to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible No \\n\\nEffects on moose and \\ncaribou habitat and \\nmortality \\n\\nLow Medium to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible  No \\n\\nEffects on traditional \\nhunting \\n\\nLow Medium to \\nLong term \\n\\nReversible  No \\n\\nEffects on guide outfitting Low Medium to \\nLong term \\n\\nReversible  No \\n\\nEffects on oilfield \\ndevelopment activities \\n\\nLow Short to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible No \\n\\nEffects on merchantable \\ntimber \\n\\nModerate Long term Reversible No \\n\\nConstruction \\n\\nEffects on consumptive \\nand non consumptive \\nrecreation \\n\\nLow Medium to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible No \\n\\nEffects on furbearer habitat \\nand mortality \\n\\nLow Short to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible No \\n\\nEffects on trapper harvest \\nand income \\n\\nLow Short to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible No \\n\\nEffects on moose and \\ncaribou habitat and \\nmortality \\n\\nLow Medium to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible  No \\n\\nEffects on traditional \\nhunting \\n\\nLow Medium to \\nLong term \\n\\nReversible  No \\n\\nEffects on guide outfitting Low Medium to \\nLong term \\n\\nReversible  No \\n\\nEffects on oilfield \\ndevelopment activities \\n\\nLow Short to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible No \\n\\nEffects on merchantable \\ntimber \\n\\nModerate Long term Reversible No \\n\\nOperations \\n\\nEffects on consumptive \\nand non consumptive \\nrecreation \\n\\nLow Medium to \\nlong term \\n\\nReversible No \\n\\nNotes: 1 Magnitude/Extent – refers to the degree of change (or risk) to land use opportunities \\nLow or Moderate – possible effect on local (within two km) land use opportunities \\nHigh – possible effect on land use opportunities beyond 2 km-wide corridor \\n2 Duration – refers to the length of time over which the project-related effect is measurable \\nShort term – less than one year \\nMedium term – greater than one year but not beyond life of project \\nLong term – beyond life of project \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-181\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n3 Reversibility – refers to the potential for conditions to return to baseline conditions, in the absence \\nof the project \\n\\nReversible – will likely revert to baseline conditions following end of project life or before \\nNon-reversible – unlikely to revert to baseline conditions following end of project life \\n4 Potential for Measurable Contribution to Cumulative Effects \\nYes – measurable contribution to CE within Regional Study Area \\nNo – no measurable contribution to CE within the Regional Study Area  \\n\\n13.9.6.2.1 Furbearers \\n\\nThe marten was identified as the representative furbearer species of concern for the \\nProject. The Project development (ROW clearing) will generally result in the localized \\nconversion of a forest community to an early successional graminoid/forb and low shrub \\ncommunity in the short to medium term. While this conversion will locally reduce denning \\nand escape cover for marten, it will also result in a foraging area for marten in close \\nproximity to cover, once small mammals (e.g., voles, deer mice) reoccupy the ROW. \\nTherefore, the ROW development will not represent a significant loss of marten habitat, \\neither locally or regionally. Further, the proposed ROW will be 25 m in width, and even \\ncombined with existing linear corridors, will not be sufficiently wide to impair cross ROW \\nmovements. \\n\\nThe risk of significant construction-related noise disturbance (and reduced habitat \\navailability) will be minimal for marten, other furbearers, and small mammals in the vicinity \\nof the Project area. While small territorial animals such as marten and most other \\nfurbearers will avoid a ROW during actual construction, these animals will not significantly \\nshift their territorial distributions in response to ROWs (Morgantini 1994; Eccles and \\nDuncan 1987), particularly once vegetative cover has become re-established on the ROW. \\nFor beaver, wetland habitats will be avoided where possible, and impacts are therefore \\nexpected to be minor. \\n\\nLimited high quality habitat for marten occurs in the LSA for spring, summer/fall, or winter \\nrange (see Table 13.7-7, Figures 13.7-19, 13.7-20, 13.7-21). Most marten habitat in the \\nLSA was rated as either low or nil/very low quality during the three seasons (Appendix 13H-\\n3). Therefore, it is expected that both the construction and operations phases of the Project \\nwill not affect habitat availability for marten within the LSA and are therefore not considered \\nto contribute to cumulative effects.  \\n\\nAt baseline, limited (13.4 percent) high quality habitat for beaver exists in close proximity to \\nthe proposed Pipeline (i.e., within a 60 m buffer around suitable wetland habitat) (Table \\n13.7-8). Both the construction and operations phase of the Project will reduce baseline high \\nquality habitat for beaver by less than 1 percent (Table 13.7-8). In addition, less than one \\nkm of the Pipeline corridor alignment will directly intercept wetland types that may support \\nbeaver (see Section 13.6.1.3). Although long-term, these effects represent a low magnitude \\nchange in habitat availability, and are therefore not considered to contribute to cumulative \\neffects. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-182\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nProject-related mortality may occur as a result of collisions with project vehicles or direct \\ndestruction of roosts, or maternal dens for martens. Mortalities incurred from destruction of \\nden sites and roosts are expected to be minimal as are mortality resulting from collisions \\nwith project vehicles. Therefore, project contributions are not expected to contribute to \\ncumulative effects of mortality rates for marten. \\n\\n13.9.6.2.2 Trapping \\n\\nThe wildlife assessment findings indicate that the minimal reduction in habitat availability \\nand increased risk of project-related mortality during construction and Pipeline operations \\nshould not significantly affect the furbearers that reside in the LSA. As a result, the impact \\non trapper harvest and associated income should not be significant. This conclusion is \\nconsistent with feedback received from trappers in the affected trapping areas. None of the \\ntrappers interviewed expressed concern about potential project-related reduction in fur \\nharvest (McCarthy 2003, pers. comm.; Capot Blanc 2003, pers. comm., Loe 2003, pers. \\ncomm.; J.B. Tally 2003, pers. comm.; Sutha 2003, pers. comm.; Denechoan Sr. 2003, pers. \\ncomm.; W. Tally 2003, pers. comm.) \\n\\nAdvance notification of construction schedule and Pipeline routing to all potentially affected \\ntrappers will provide an opportunity, as necessary, to relocate their traplines and \\nequipment. Should relocation of trapline be required to prevent loss or destruction of traps, \\nit is recommended that the trapper be compensated for their time and inconvenience. \\n\\nPoaching of furbearer was identified as an issue by a FNFN trappers whose trapping area \\nis located outside the LSA and RSA. The trapper felt that ever increasing industry-related \\naccess in the region was a contributing factor. Although there is no factual evidence that \\npoaching is occurring on traplines in the region, this issue will be addressed by the Project \\nthrough prohibition of hunting and trapping by construction workers and access control \\nmeasures during Pipeline operations.  \\n\\n13.9.6.2.3 Caribou and Moose \\n\\nReduced Habitat Availability \\n\\nCaribou and moose were identified as representative ungulate species of concern for the \\nProject that are traditionally hunted by trappers and other members of the Fort Nelson First \\nNation and Dene Tha First Nation.  \\n\\nThe caribou occupying a variety of habitat types within large territories, thus diminishing \\n(but not precluding) the likelihood of significant effects on important localized habitats from \\noil and gas development (well site, access road and pipeline development). Caribou and \\nmoose may use the grass and shrub-dominated communities which will develop along \\nmost of the ROW as a forage source. Therefore, once reclaimed the ROW will provide a \\npotential foraging area for these species in close proximity to escape cover. In general, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-183\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\ndirect Project effects to habitat will be too localized to result in significant reductions in \\nhabitat availability from physical habitat alteration. \\n\\nNew ROWs can lead to the fragmentation of caribou habitat but they represent only \\n33 percent of the total Pipeline ROW. While reclaimed ROWs per se do not represent an \\nimpediment to caribou movements, they may contribute to long term recreational activities \\nor increased predator movements in otherwise remote, inaccessible habitat, resulting in the \\nloss of core security habitat. This issue is dealt with in more detail under the discussion on \\ndirect and indirect mortality. \\n\\nConstruction activities may lead to sensory disturbance and reduced habitat availability for \\ncaribou and moose. However, there is no evidence to suggest that such short-term \\ndisplacement persists or results in significant decreases in local animal numbers. \\n\\nCurrently the LSA provides little high quality habitat for either caribou or moose, largely due \\nto the less productive habitat types of black spruce in the region. In addition, previous and \\nongoing human land use activities (primarily oil and gas development activities) have \\ncontributed to reductions in ungulate habitat availability in the LSA.  \\n\\nPotential changes in habitat availability were calculated for both caribou and moose during \\ndifferent seasons (Section 13.7). The construction phase of the proposed Project will not \\nreduce baseline spring habitat availability for caribou within the LSA (see Tables 13.7-3 ). \\nFor moose the construction phase of the proposed Project will not reduce baseline spring \\nhigh quality habitat within the LSA, but will reduce early winter range by 17.0 percent and \\nlate winter range by 15.6 percent  (see Table 13.7-4). Because of the short term nature of \\nconstruction effects, these effects are not considered to contribute to cumulative effects.  \\n\\nIncluding project effects during the operational phase, baseline high quality spring habitat \\nfor caribou within the LSA will increase by 2.4 percent (see Table 13.7-3). This positive \\nchange in habitat quality is due to the increase in sedge and grass habitat types along the \\ncleared Pipeline ROW, which are preferred forage types for caribou during the spring. This \\nlong-term effect represents a positive change in habitat availability within the LSA, and is \\nnot considered to contribute to negative cumulative effects. \\n\\nIncluding project effects during the operational phase, baseline spring high quality habitat \\nfor moose within the LSA will be increased by 2.0 percent and by 0.9 percent for summer \\n/fall  Early winter range will be reduced by 17.0 percent and late winter range will be \\nreduced by 15.7 percent (see Table 13.7-4, Figures 13.7-6, 13.7-7, 13.7-8, 13.7-9). \\nAlthough long-term, these effects represent a relatively low magnitude change in habitat \\navailability. It is expected that access control measures implemented in the Hay River area \\nwill reduce the effect on high quality moose habitat. Therefore, changes to habitat \\navailability for moose are not considered to contribute to cumulative effects. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-184\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nDirect and Indirect Mortality \\n\\nDirect project-related caribou or moose mortalities may occur during both construction and \\noperations from collisions with project vehicles and from unrestricted use of firearms by \\nproject personnel. However, construction timing and adoption of personnel codes of \\nconduct (firearm restrictions) will help mitigate these potential mortality risks that are \\ndirectly related to the proposed Project. Of most concern is the potential for increased \\naccess into the area and associated increased risk of mortality. A potential increase in \\naccess along the Pipeline ROW may affect caribou and moose by increasing mortality from \\nboth natural predators (e.g., wolves) or hunting by humans.. The risk of access-induced \\ncaribou mortality associated with new ROW development was assessed using core security \\nanalyses and change in access use potential.  \\n\\nAs described in Section 13.7.6.2.1.3, it was determined that during construction and \\noperations, the Project will contribute incrementally to a loss in caribou core security \\nhabitat. However, relative to baseline conditions, these project effects will represent low-\\nmagnitude reductions for core security habitat. The project effects are expected to be \\nmedium-term in duration, as access control and revegetation of the Pipeline ROW will \\nreduce both direct and indirect mortality risk. Therefore, change to core security habitat for \\ncaribou is not considered to contribute to cumulative effects.  \\n\\nThe length of ROW representing improved access potential was calculated. The Project will \\nincrease the high potential use level to 83 km during construction, and then will \\nsubsequently return to 20.5 km at operations. Low use potential access will increase from \\n0 km at baseline to 62.5 km at operations. This increase is due to the conservative \\nassumption that the Pipeline will represent low use after construction. It is expected that \\nmitigation and specific access control measures will further reduce access along the \\nPipeline corridor, where large areas of the Pipeline will be inaccessible. \\n\\nWhile the increase in high potential use access during construction may have implications \\non habitat fragmentation and increased mortality risk for ungulates, this impact will be \\nshort-term, and is therefore not considered to contribute to cumulative effects. Similarly, the \\nconservative estimate of increase in low use access potential during operations is not \\nconsidered to contribute to cumulative effects. \\n\\n13.9.6.2.4 Traditional Hunting \\n\\nThrough implementation of firearms restrictions during Project construction and access \\ncontrols on the ROW during Project operations, the likelihood of increased harvesting of \\nmoose and caribou by non-traditional hunters is low. Natural predators will not be deterred \\nby access controls but given that the Project follows existing ROW for 76 percent of the \\nroute, the potential increase in moose and caribou mortality by natural predators should \\nalso be low in magnitude. As a result, it is concluded that project-related effects on \\ntraditional hunting in the LSA and RSA are not significant in the short or long term and \\ntherefore are not considered to contribute to cumulative effects.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-185\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.9.6.2.5 Guide Outfitting \\n\\nTaking into consideration the mitigation measures designed to minimize project-related \\neffects on wildlife (construction timing, access controls, firearm restrictions) along with the \\nfact that there are no guide outfitting allocations in the British Columbia portion of the \\nProject and only five kilometres of the Pipeline extends into Alberta adjacent to an existing \\nROW, the impact on Alberta guide outfitters with allocations in WMU 536 will be negligible. \\n\\n13.9.6.2.6 Nexen Oilfield Development \\n\\nIn recognition of potential project-related adverse effects on Nexen’s current and future \\noilfield, a combination of mitigation measures are proposed including rerouting the Pipeline \\nto reduce or eliminate access issues, road use and/or road maintenance agreements with \\nNexen, boring beneath winter roads, increasing the depth of cover and pipe coating at \\nwinter road crossing(s) that cannot be avoided. These mitigation options have been \\ndiscussed with and are acceptable to Nexen Canada (Siemens 2003, pers. comm.). \\n\\n13.9.6.2.7 Loss of Merchantable Timber \\n\\nAlthough no commercial timber harvesting operations are encountered along the Pipeline \\nroute, some merchantable coniferous and deciduous timber will be logged during clearing \\nof the Pipeline ROW and valve sites. EnCana has been directed by provincial forest \\nmanagement and sustainability agencies in British Columbia and Alberta to salvage \\nmerchantable timber that is removed and not needed for construction activities. Clearing \\ncontractors from British Columbia and Alberta will harvest and salvage merchantable timber \\nfor sale to forest products manufacturers in British Columbia and Alberta. As a result, there \\nwill be no project-related loss of merchantable timber. \\n\\n13.9.7 Cumulative Effects Implications \\n\\nThe project effects on land and resource uses in the LSA and RSA are of a magnitude, \\nduration and reversibility after mitigation that they are not considered to contribute to \\ncumulative regional effects (Table 13.7-11 in Section 13.7.6.4 summarizes effects on \\nwildlife species of concern).  \\n\\n13.9.7.1 Significance of Effects \\n\\nThe significance of impacts on land and resource use in the LSA and RSA was assessed \\nby considering the nature of potential impacts, the mitigative strategies that are available \\nfor reducing or eliminating such impacts, and the nature and anticipated severity of residual \\nimpacts after mitigation. Significance was determined for impacts where project effects \\nwere expected to contribute cumulative effects.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-186\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nAfter mitigation, the residual project-related effects on trapping, traditional hunting, guide \\noutfitting, oil and gas exploration and development, protected areas, commercial timber \\nharvesting, consumptive and non consumptive recreation will not be significant. \\n\\n13.9.8 Follow Up and Monitoring \\n\\nHabitat reclamation, following Pipeline construction (i.e., planting native shrubs and \\nseeding with native seed mixes) and access control measures (i.e., gates, rollback, berms, \\nand planting of native shrubs as visual barriers) are the primary mitigation options for \\nensuring that long-term negative impacts to wildlife (and trapping and traditional hunting \\nwhich are dependant on the wildlife), are minimized. Effectiveness of these mitigation \\nactivities will be monitored as part of routine pipeline inspection. If revegetation activities in \\nsome areas of the Pipeline ROW fail, the necessary actions will be taken until functional \\nplant communities are firmly established.  \\n\\nSince project effects on wildlife species of concern are not anticipated to significantly \\ncontribute to cumulative effects, long-term monitoring of these wildlife populations has not \\nbeen proposed. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-187\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.10 Traditional Land Use Study \\n\\nThe Project is located on the traditional territories of two First Nations: the Fort Nelson First \\nNation and the Dene Tha’ First Nation. Identifying traditional use sites within the LSA is a \\npriority to interpreting the potential impacts of pipeline development to traditional resources. \\nA full-scale traditional land use study (TLUS) of the traditional territory of the Dene Tha’, \\nThe Dene Tha’ Traditional Land-Use and Occupancy Study (1997), provides a basis for \\nconsultation with the Dene Tha’ relative to the proposed Project. During preliminary \\ndiscussion with the Dene Tha’ Band Council it was suggested by council that the Dene Tha’ \\nGPS technicians document any unrecorded heritage resource sites identified during field \\nassessment to augment the existing TLUS. \\n\\nThe Fort Nelson First Nation does not currently have a TLUS. Traditional land use \\nconsultation will be route specific within the proposed study corridor and will deal with \\npotential impact to environmental, socio-economic and heritage resources. The heritage \\nresources survey crew assistants from the local First Nations will also act as consultants to \\ntraditional land use during the field study. Additionally, consultation with elders of the local \\nFirst Nations and band members with knowledge of the study area will be undertaken to \\ndetermine possible impacts and community values relative to newly identified heritage \\nresource sites. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-188\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.11 Heritage/Historical Resources \\n\\n13.11.1 Baseline Setting \\n\\nThe Project study area is situated in two provincial jurisdictions, British Columbia and \\nAlberta. The British Columbia portion consists of 78 km whereas the Alberta segment is \\nrepresented by 5 km. It is necessary to conduct the heritage resources survey under two \\nsets of heritage resources assessment guidelines.  \\n\\n13.11.1.1 Environmental Setting \\n\\n13.11.1.1.1 Introduction \\n\\nPrecontact economic strategies as well as many aspects of the material culture of the \\nhuman inhabitants were intimately related to the opportunities and constraints provided by \\ntheir regional environment. In many respects, regional environment also strongly influenced \\nwhere certain activities were conducted and consequently, where archaeological sites, \\ntestimony to precontact use and occupation are located. Terrain influenced many forms of \\nhuman activity, directing travel, biasing routes of communication, enhancing or limiting \\nresource procurement activities, and restricting human occupation areas to selected \\nlocalities. As a result, human populations were not uniformly distributed across the \\nlandscape, but were clustered within the most suitable habitats.  \\n\\n13.11.1.1.2 Regional Environment \\n\\nThe Project study corridor is situated in the Taiga Plains Ecoprovince of the Sub-Arctic \\nEcodivision extending from the Fort Nelson River Basin to the border of the Northwest \\nTerritories. As part of the Boreal Forest Natural Region, long winters and short summers \\ncharacterize the area. River areas are dominated by balsam poplar, while better-drained \\nareas support white and black spruce, lodgepole pine and tamarack. Wetlands and muskeg \\nare extensive due to poor drainage and bogs, fens, swamps, and marshes cover much of \\nthe area. The Taiga Plains Ecoprovince covers the northeastern portion of British \\nColumbia, and is characterized as a large lowland dissected below the Alberta Plain by the \\nLiard, Fort Nelson, and Petitot Rivers. Vegetation is dominated by the Boreal White and \\nBlack Spruce Zone that includes extensive black spruce bogs and wetlands (Alberta \\nEnvironmental Protection 1994; Government of British Columbia 2003, Internet site). Soil \\nmaterials in this area are derived from glacial, colluvial and alluvial deposits. Good forest \\ngrowth is found in this area, particularly in soils of the alluvial flats, which are dominated by \\nwhite spruce and balsam poplar. Above the river flood plains, black spruce and lodgepole \\npine are found in extensive pure and mixed stands (Rowe 1972).  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-189\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.11.1.1.3 Local Environment \\n\\nThe Taiga Plains Ecoprovince is divided into three Ecoregions with one Ecosection in \\nBritish Columbia. The Hay River Lowland Ecoregion is a broad lowland area lying below \\nthe Alberta Plateau on its north and south sides. The Fort Nelson Lowland Ecosection is \\nphysiographically part of the Alberta Plateau on the south side but has a climatic \\nassociation with the boreal climates of the lower, northern Interior plains (Government of \\nBritish Columbia 2003, Internet site). The Wetland Mixedwood Subregion of the Boreal \\nForest in which the Project study area is located contains mainly organic and gleysolic \\nsoils. Vegetation contains peatlands, willow-sedge wetlands and upland black spruce \\nforests.  \\n\\n13.11.1.2 Heritage Resource Context \\n\\n13.11.1.2.1 Precontact Record \\n\\nThe Project area is part of a physiographic continuum with the southern Yukon. In this \\ncontext, archaeological research in the southern Yukon is relevant to northeastern British \\nColumbia. The earliest archaeological research in southwestern Yukon and northern British \\nColumbia was conducted by Johnson and Raup (1964 and R. S. MacNeish (1964) in the \\n1940s. MacNeish’s work continued into the 1650s and 1960s when a number of \\nexcavations were also completed in southwest Yukon, adjacent British Columbia and the \\nwestern District of Mackenzie, Northwest Territories (MacNeish 1960). This work resulted in \\na sequence of cultural development spanning some 12,000 years. The initial sequence \\ndefined by MacNeish (1964) was re-examined and revised largely through academic \\nresearch in the 1970s.  \\n\\nAlthough few archaeological sites with diagnostic artifacts have been identified in the \\nnorthern interior of British Columbia, detailed archaeological studies have been completed \\nat the Charlie Lake Site at Fort St. John (Fladmark et al. 1988) and at the Pink Mountain \\nSite northwest of Fort St. John by Wilson (1989) relative to early Clovis materials. Evidence \\nfor early occupation recovered from the Charlie Lake Site includes Clovis projectile points \\nradiocarbon dated to ca. 10,400 years ago (Fladmark et al. 1988). Approximately 150 \\nkilometres northwest of Fort St. John, two Clovis point bases as well as Scottsbluff, \\nPlainview, Lerma, and a later possible Salmon River projectile point and a microblade core \\nwere also recovered at the Pink Mountain Site (Wilson 1989). The Peace River – Grande \\nPrairie region in Alberta is also known for its Paleo-Indian materials including Clovis, \\nAlberta-Scottsbluff, Browns Valley-Frederick, and Plainview (Wormington and Forbis 1965; \\nMagne 1986). \\n\\nThe archaeological sequence for the RSA is largely based on the cultural materials \\nexcavated north of the study area at Fisherman Lake, Northwest Territories (Fedirchuk \\n1970, 1973; Millar 1968, 1981). The earliest evidence of human occupation found at \\nFisherman Lake has been associated with the Cordilleran Tradition, characterized by leaf-\\nshaped projectile points. Well documented and more widely found is the Northern Plano \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-190\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nTradition (7000 - 4000 B.C.) viewed as a northerly expansion of plains hunters and \\ncharacterized by large, lanceolate spear points comparable to Agate Basin types far to the \\nsouth. Both the nature and precision of finishing technology varies between fine, parallel, \\nripple flaking to generalized, broad flaking. Notable in the associated assemblages is the \\npresence of burins and gravers.  \\n\\nAt approximately 4000 B.C., a significant change occurs in the assemblages from \\nFisherman Lake with the appearance of microblade technology. Sites of the Northwest \\nMicroblade Tradition are numerous in the locality. Other characteristic traits (in addition to \\nmicroblade technology) include lanceolate, stemmed, and notched projectile points, \\nscrapers made from large core remnants, side blades, burins, drills, gravers, and grooved \\nsandstone abraders. Unique to this tradition is the presence of extensive workshops \\nidentified with the Julian Technology, a bifacial reduction procedure associated with a \\nspecific quality of chert, Julian Chert, occurring as erosional nodules. Although it represents \\na major lithic component of the archaeological materials at Fisherman Lake, the source of \\nthis characteristic chert has, to date, not been identified. \\n\\nThe succeeding components are viewed as representing the gradual development of the \\nAthabaskan culture as observed among the Slavey people at the time of contact. Initially \\nvisible at approximately 2000 B.C., this tradition is characterized by a variety of tools and \\nmany notched forms of projectile points. Components relating to the contact period contain \\nadmixtures of European trade goods such as clay pipes and metal tools.  \\n\\n13.11.1.2.2 Proposed Model of Precontact Land Use \\n\\nAt the present time, the study region is occupied by the Fort Nelson First Nation and Dene \\nTha’ First Nation. Jenness (1977) describes population distribution in northern Canada at \\napproximately 1725 A.D. He places the Chipewyan primarily to the east and north of Lake \\nAthabasca. The Beaver inhabited the regions associated with Peace River whereas the \\nSlavey occupied the lands between Great Slave Lake and Lake Athabasca and the lands \\nwest along the Mackenzie River. The Beaver and Slavey had been pushed westward \\nduring the protohistoric and early historic period.  \\n\\nFedirchuk (n.d.) has developed a model of the economic pattern of the Slavey based on \\nethnographic literature and fieldwork among the Slavey peoples of Fisherman Lake \\nadjacent to Fort Liard, Northwest Territories. Fish provided a mainstay, comprising \\napproximately one-half of the diet (Honigmann 1946; Jenness 1977; Stafford 1959). The \\nlargest population gatherings occurred in the summers around a ‘fish lake’. The lakes acted \\nas strategic locales for articulation with other groups and availability of resources. They \\nalso served as strategically located centers for mobilization, communication, and trade. \\nLarge camp size would have continued into early fall to take communal advantage of large \\nschools of spawning whitefish.  \\n\\nBetween July and September, fish weirs were constructed in shallow creeks and rivers. \\nThese semi-permanent ‘fish lake’ settlements were also used as a base for hunting parties \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-191\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nand collection of roots and berries. Group size at this time was thought to consist of two \\nnuclear families. Large game animals such as moose, bear, elk, woodland bison, and \\nwoodland caribou were utilized as well as smaller animals, mostly rabbit. \\n\\nHonigmann (1946) was told that two or three families on Great Slave Lake could obtain four \\nto five thousand whitefish in late October and early November. These were dried and \\ncached for winter use. A variety of berries were collected in late summer and fall. Wild \\ncarrot, wild onion, wild rhubarb, and mushrooms were also utilized. Men were responsible \\nfor most of the hunting but women trapped for smaller mammals such as rabbit. Moose \\nwere taken by bow and arrow or by snares set along favoured runs bounded on both sides \\nby fences of willows. Occasionally, natural features suitable for impoundment were used to \\ntrap moose. Bear and woodland bison might also be taken by spearing. Bear snares were \\nset in berry patches. \\n\\nDuring the height of the winter food became scarce and hunting was supplemented by \\nfishing through the ice (VanStone 1974). Honigmann (1946:40) noted that the local group \\nlived together during the winter at some fish lake and subsisted principally on the fish they \\ncould obtain through the ice. In the spring, a welcome addition to their diet was the \\nreturning migratory waterfowl. Later, the eggs of waterfowl provided a supplementary food \\nsource. Summer was marked by a return to the ‘fish lakes’ and re-establishment of kin ties. \\nWoodland bison and moose were run down on snowshoes in spring, and were snared \\nduring summer and winter (Jenness 1977). \\n\\nWeirs, traps, and nets were used for fishing. Lakes formed the pivotal points for human \\npopulation movements particularly in winter and less ‘predictable’ times of seasonal \\nscarcity of other resources throughout the year. Lakes were probably never completely \\nabandoned by native populations at any time of the year. Early journals suggest that lakes \\nwere more intensively used by elderly natives whereas the younger, more able men tended \\nto go on long extended hunts. The elderly exploited more dependable areas, basing \\nthemselves primarily on the lake fish resources but making sporadic and geographically \\nmore limited hunting excursions. \\n\\nIn this model, large multi-component base camps would be located along the edge of lakes, \\nconcentrated at good fisheries. These sites would contain a wide variety of tool types that \\nare representative of the wide range of activities required for camp maintenance. Faunal \\nremains in these sites would reflect year round utilization and provide evidence of \\nsecondary butchering. Sites radiating out from the base camps would be expected to \\ncontain a more restricted range of tool types indicative of task specific activities. Faunal \\nmaterial recovered at kill sites and hunting camps would bear evidence of primary \\nbutchering.  \\n\\n13.11.1.2.3 Historical Overview \\n\\nFort Nelson was founded in 1805 by the North West Company and named after Admiral \\nNelson, hero of the Battle of Trafalger. In 1813, the post was destroyed by local natives. It \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-192\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nwas abandoned until 1865 when it was rebuilt by the Hudson’s Bay Company on a new \\nlocation across the river and adjacent to the present town of Fort Nelson. \\n\\nEstablishment of posts in the northern interior of British Columbia largely post-dated the \\nmerger of the North West Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company of 1821, for example, \\nFort Halkett (1829–1832; 1832–1875), Lower Post (1872–), and Dease Lake (1838–1839). \\nThese posts were short lived as the coastal Tlingit provided better and cheaper trade goods \\nto the local inhabitants. Lower Post was founded as Liard Post by Robert Sylvester, a \\nprivate trader, and was bought by the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1876. Because of the \\nconfusion with Fort Liard on the Liard River in modern Northwest Territories, it came to be \\ncalled Lower Post (Wright 1976: 171). With the loss of fur trade monopoly in 1858, the role \\nof the fur trade in native life diminished. Subsequent devaluation of furs further limited the \\ninfluence of the traders in the area.  \\n\\nFort Nelson remained in relative isolation until the Klondike gold rush when the Edmonton \\nTrail was promoted as a viable route to the Yukon. As gold fever swept North America, \\nEdmonton attempted to capitalize on the gold rush by promoting an overland route to the \\nYukon originating in Edmonton. While the so-called Edmonton route suggested that a \\nsingle well defined trail to the Klondike existed, it actually consisted of a bewildering tangle \\nof branching trails, none of them well defined…(Berton 1972: 218). Two branches of the \\nEdmonton trail led to Fort Nelson: one from Fort St. John and the other from Peace River \\nCrossing (MacGregor 1970). The trails were opened by W.P. Taylor, hired by the town \\ncouncil of Edmonton to establish a roadway from the Peace River Crossing to Fort Nelson \\nand then westward to Pelly River (Berton 1972: 222). Taylor began blazing the trail from \\nPeace River Crossing on March 17, 1898 and reached Fort Nelson on April 8, 1898. From \\nthe confluence of the Sikanni Chief and the Fontas Rivers, the route followed an old ‘Indian’ \\ntrail along the high ground immediately east of the Fort Nelson River towards Fort Nelson.  \\n\\nOn the return trip from the Yukon, Taylor stopped at Fort Nelson, but instead of returning \\nalong his earlier route to Peace River Crossing, he chose to establish a route southward to \\nFort St. John which he believed was the best route to Fort Nelson. However, few \\nKlondikers used it. Most Klondikers heading for the Yukon via Fort Nelson went through \\nPeace River Crossing. They soon realized that the Edmonton route consisted of little more \\nthan slash marks on trees. The route was virtually impassable and expedition after \\nexpedition met with disaster. While the Edmonton route had been promoted as the practical \\nroute to the gold fields, it would later be described as the ‘worst trail of death’ in western \\nCanadian history. In the words of one traveler, it was ‘the most infernal swindle ever placed \\nin front of the public’ (Weir 1988: 9-11). It was not until the 1920s that a well-established \\npack trail existed between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John. From Fort Nelson, the trail skirted \\nthe high ground along the Prophet River and crossed the Sikanni Chief River where it likely \\nincorporated part of Taylor’s earlier Klondike Trail. According to Young (1980: 33), the trail \\nwas blazed by Joe Apsassin, a Cree from the Blueberry Reserve and a white trapper \\nnamed Glen Minaker in 1919–1920. Cornwallis King (1943: 42) recounted that the trail was \\ncut by P.A. Godsell of the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1925. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-193\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nIn the 1920s Fort Nelson was a small primitive, isolated community with less than 200 \\nIndians and a handful of white men set in the middle of a vast uninhabited forest land \\n(Young 1980: 31). It was not until the completion of the Alcan (Alaska) Highway in 1943, \\nwhich ran from Dawson Creek to Fairbanks, Alaska, that Fort Nelson was effectively placed \\non a major communication route. Despite the traders, explorers, and scientists passing \\nnorth and south of the study region, including the Yukon Expedition of geologists under the \\ndirection of George Dawson and accompanied by Richard McConnell and William Ogilvie in \\n1887, northern British Columbia remained isolated from historic developments. The need \\nfor a passable and affordable transportation link to the Klondike gold fields was recognized \\nin the late 19th century. Despite several proposals put forth in the early 20th century to \\nconstruct a road into the Yukon, it was not until World War II and the Japanese threat after \\nthe strike against Pearl Harbour that the commitment was made to construct a permanent \\nroad through northern British Columbia. The Northwest Staging Route, based on the air \\nmail route between Edmonton and Whitehorse, was chosen for mobilization of construction \\npersonnel and equipment in the Canadian segment. For much of the route, traditional First \\nNation trails were followed and native guides used to survey the final route. Construction in \\nthis wilderness faced many challenges. For example, ...the men west of Fort Nelson faced \\nboth endless forest and bottomless muskeg, and progress was barely perceptible for weeks \\nat a time (Lundberg 1999: 20). \\n\\n13.11.1.3 First Nations Consultation \\n\\nThe Fort Nelson First Nation and the Dene Tha’ First Nation are identified as stakeholders \\nin the proposed development area.  \\n\\nConsultation with the Fort Nelson First Nation and the Dene Tha’ First Nation was initiated \\nin November 2002 and continues in 2003 with an introduction to the Project and a \\nproposed timeline for field assessments and construction. Consultation with the First \\nNations will be ongoing during construction, and band members will be involved in assisting \\nwith the field reconnaissance for heritage resources studies. Should significant heritage \\nresource sites be identified during the assessment, First Nations members and elders in \\nparticular will be consulted. \\n\\n13.11.1.4 Previous Studies \\n\\nOther Archaeological Impact Assessments (AIA) have been conducted in the northeastern \\nBritish Columbia and northwestern Alberta study region, primarily due to gas and oil \\nexploration. In the study area, the west end of the Project will tie in with the EnCana Sierra \\ngas plant, an area previously surveyed on behalf of AEC Oil & Gas Co, Ltd. (now EnCana \\nCorporation) and included two pipelines, a compressor site and ancillary facilities \\n(Wondrasek and McKillop 1999). Wondrasek (ibid.) found the area to be previously \\ndisturbed by road development, oil and gas development, and clearing, grading, and topsoil \\nstripping incurred by the Sierra North and South Pipelines and Compressor site \\n(Wondrasek and McKillop 1999). No new heritage resources sites were recorded during \\nthat survey.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-194\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nIn the Project area there is one study that parallels the proposed Project is the CU Power \\nRainbow Lake to Wescup (Fort Nelson) 144 kV Transmission Line Project (McCullough \\n1990). This transmission corridor extends east and west, and is south of the proposed \\nProject and north of Ekwan Lake. The survey concentrated on the crossings of the Hay and \\nNelson Rivers with negative results. No heritage resource sites were identified and efforts \\nto locate the historic Klondike Trail at the point that it crossed the transmission corridor \\nwere unsuccessful, possible due to overgrowth of forest cover. Overgrowth of historic trails \\nhinders the identification of routes important to the heritage and development of local \\ncommunities and can be addressed in many cases though consultation with community \\nmembers.  \\n\\nPrevious AIA’s conducted adjacent to the study area surround the proposed Project. The \\nLittle Hay River Project for Wascana Energy Inc. (now known as Nexen Canada Ltd.) \\nlocated east of Fort Nelson and west of Rainbow Lake Alberta, did not locate any heritage \\nresources sites. It was suggested at that time that, the majority of the proposed \\ndevelopment was located in areas of low potential for archaeological resources. These \\nincluded low, wet sections composed predominantly of black spruce and tamarack in \\nmuskeg areas (Fedirchuk and Meyer 2000). The heritage resource survey of \\nTransCanada’s cancelled Liard Extension Pipeline Project to the north and northeast of the \\nLSA yielded two cultural resource sites, one culturally modified tree site and two trail sites \\n(Wondrasek and Green 1999a).  \\n\\nOther projects in the northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta area include: \\nthe Maxhamish gas plant and Pipeline Projects (Wondrasek and Green 1999b, 1999c); the \\nRing Border Pedigree Gas Field for Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd. (Bussey 1990, 1992); \\nSummit Resources investigations in the Fort Nelson area (Bussey 1995); additional \\nCanadian Hunter Exploration Ltd. developments (Bussey 1998); the Fort Nelson Timber \\nSupply Area for Slocan Forest Products Ltd. (Prager 1997); and Ridington’s investigations \\n(2000).  \\n\\nVery few heritage resource sites were identified during these investigations. Few moderate \\nto high potential areas for archaeological resources exist due to the low-lying wetland \\nenvironment in the study area of all these projects. River crossings with elevated terraces \\nor ridges and other elevated areas are considered to be high potential for heritage \\nresources. While it is true that a high percentage of archaeological sites are located on \\nthese landforms, the opportunity for locating heritage resources in other areas does exist. \\n\\n13.11.1.5 Site File Search \\n\\nInformation on the nature, contents, and locations of heritage sites was acquired through a \\nsite file search of the site survey records maintained by the Provincial Heritage Register of \\nthe Archaeology Branch of the Provincial Government of British Columbia. National \\nTopographic Sheet (NTS) map sheets 94 I/9, 94 I/10, and 94 I/11 display the area through \\nwhich the development zone passes. In Alberta the record review consists of a search of \\nthe Archaeological Site Inventory Data records maintained by the Historic Sites Service, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-195\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nCultural Facilities and Historical Resources Division, Alberta Community Development for \\nTownships 110 and 111 west of the sixth Meridian. \\n\\nThree heritage sites have been recorded in the study area: IeRf-1, IeRg-1, and IeRh-1 (see \\nFigure 13.11-1; Table 13.11-1). These precontact sites are located at the west end of the \\nproposed Project and north of the existing gas plant facility where the proposed Pipeline \\nwill tie in. The sites consist of limited materials; a single piece of black chert shatter was \\nrecovered from IeRf-1 and a single quartzite secondary flake was identified from IeRg-1. \\nNeither of these artifacts was identified in the field, but came from frozen sediments during \\nlaboratory analysis. No description is given for the surface lithics identified at IeRh-1. \\nHowever, the true nature of these sites remains unknown, as no detailed assessment was \\nundertaken due initially to poor weather conditions, and subsequently due to cancellation of \\nthe associated proposed Pipeline. No palaeontological sites are identified.  \\n\\nDue to the limited number of sites recorded in the area of the site file search and the lack of \\ndetailed assessment at the individual sites recorded, a generalized site distribution pattern \\ncannot be extracted from the database and projected to the proposed development zones. \\nThe low density of the sites in the area of the site file search is unlikely to reflect a low \\npotential for heritage resources. Rather, the recorded site distribution is a factor of the \\nlimited amount of field investigation conducted in the general region. \\n\\n13.11.1.6 Field Survey Program \\n\\nTo verify elements of the baseline information discussed above, and to provide additional \\ndetail for the mitigation strategies discussed in the following sections, a heritage resources \\nfield survey program is planned in 2003. The results of this field survey described below will \\nbe submitted to the NEB upon finalization. \\n\\nThe heritage resources field survey to be conducted is detailed in Section 13.11.4 \\nProposed Assessment. Timing of this survey is weather dependent and thus may be \\ndelayed by snow or ice conditions. \\n\\nA survey will be conducted by a field crew that includes two archaeological consultants and \\ntwo members from each of the local First Nations. As heritage resource survey requires \\nexcavation by shovel of potential site locations, it is expected that the heritage resource \\nsurvey will take place in late May or early June, 2003. \\n\\n\\n\\n10 0 10 20 30\\n\\nScale in Kilometres\\n\\nAPPROVED\\n\\nREVISION DATE\\n\\nVOL\\n\\nFebruary 28, 2003\\n\\nArea\\nof\\nDetail\\n\\n9IeRh-1 9IeRg-1\\n9IeRf-1\\n\\nNN\\n\\nLEGEND\\n\\nPROPOSED RIGHT-OF-WAY\\n\\nHISTORICAL RESOURCES SITE\\n\\nENCANA  SIERRA PLANT\\n\\nFMA HERITAGE RESOURCES CONSULTANTS  INC.\\n\\nSOURCE -1:250 000 SURVEYS AND MAPPING BRANCH, DEPARTMENT OF \\nENERGY, MINES AND RESOURCES, 94I  FONTAS RIVER, Edition 2, NAD \\n1927\\n\\n0 km\\n\\nSCALE - 1:250 000\\n\\n10\\n\\nEKWAN PIPELINE PROJECT\\n\\nArchaeological Sites DRAFT DATE\\n\\nDRAWN\\n\\nPROJECT\\n\\nCHECKED\\n\\nFIGURE NO.\\n\\nSCALE\\nFebruary 28, 2003\\n\\nLT&AB\\n\\nPOG1045\\n\\n13.11-1\\n\\n1:250,000\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT \\n\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN \\n\\n Page 13-197 \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nTable 13.11-1 Summary of Previously Recorded Heritage Resource Sites \\nSite \\n\\nNumber \\nSite Type Site Context Site Visibility Geographical \\n\\nSetting \\nAssociation NTS Map \\n\\nReference \\nLocation \\n\\nIeRf-1 Lithic undisturbed subsurface Kyklo Access road \\n(PDR 178) \\n\\nNorth Peace 94 I/11 58o7’46” \\n120o9’99” \\n\\nIeRg-1 Lithic undisturbed subsurface Kyklo Access road \\n(PDR 178) \\n\\nNorth Peace 94 I/11 58o7’28” \\n121o0’32” \\n\\nIeRh-1 Lithics n/a surface n/a* n/a* 94 I/11 58o7’23” \\n121o2’38” \\n\\nNote: * Information is not included on the site form, but location coordinates indicate the same general area as IeRf-1 and IeRg-1. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-198\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.11.2 Results of Issues Scoping \\n\\n13.11.2.1 Background \\n\\nHeritage resources are defined by the British Columbia Heritage Conservation Act (1979) \\nas heritage objects or sites that have heritage value to British Columbia, a community or an \\naboriginal people in which heritage value refers to the historical, cultural, aesthetic, \\nscientific or educational worth or usefulness of a site or object. In Alberta, historical \\nresources are protected under the Alberta Historical Resources Act (1980) and are defined \\nas precontact, historic, and palaeontological sites and their contents. Cultural landscapes \\nand traditional use sites are also encompassed within historical resources. As such, they \\ninclude precontact archaeological sites and materials, historic and traditional sites and \\nobjects, as well as palaeontological remains. Precontact archaeological sites are comprised \\nof artifacts, features, and residues of native origin. They predate the arrival of Europeans \\nand are typically characterized by modified bone and stone implements, and stone \\nstructures. However, the identification of heritage sites without physical remains that are \\nassociated with traditional activity either in precontact or historic times recognizes an \\nimportant component of heritage resources requiring consultation with members of local \\nFirst Nations.  \\n\\nHistoric sites represent heritage resources of a more recent nature and are characterized \\nby structures, features, and objects of European influence and include First Nation sites \\nand materials. These sites date back to contact with Europeans but also include remains of \\nmore recent activity (i.e., greater than 50 years). Historic sites that are less than 50 years \\nold are generally associated with traditional land use and document continued use and \\noccupation of an area to the present time. Cultural landscapes consisting of either natural \\nor man-made features important to a societies’ sense of place are also important heritage \\nresources.  \\n\\n13.11.2.2 Nature of Heritage Resources \\n\\nHeritage resources are non-renewable and are susceptible to alteration, damage, and \\ndestruction by construction and development activities. The value of heritage resources \\ncannot be measured in terms of individual artifacts or biological specimens; their value lies \\nin the integrated information which is derived from the relationship of the individual artifacts \\nand fossil specimens, associated features, spatial relationships (distribution), and \\ncontextual situations. Interpretation of heritage resource materials, and the ability to \\ninterpret the significance of particular sites in a landscape, is based on an understanding of \\nthe nature of the relationship between individual archaeological and palaeontological \\nmaterials as well as the sediments and strata within which they are contained. As such, \\nremoval or mixing of cultural or fossil bearing sediments results in the permanent loss of \\ninformation basic to the understanding of these resources. As a result, heritage resources \\nare increasingly susceptible to destruction and depletion through disturbance.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-199\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.11.2.3 Project Effects Analysis \\n\\nHeritage resources are non-renewable and are susceptible to alteration, damage, and \\ndestruction by development projects which modify the landscape. Three dimensions of \\nimpact are relevant to effects of development on heritage resources (Fedirchuk McCullough \\n& Associates Ltd. 1983) (Table 13.11-2): \\n\\n• scale of impact \\n\\n• nature of impact \\n\\n• degree of impact \\n\\n13.11.2.3.1 Scale of Impact \\n\\nImpact occurs on three levels of heritage resource phenomena: regional, local, and site \\ndata (Lenihan 1981). Regional data includes the archaeological, historical, and \\npalaeontological resources within the region, the environmental context within which the \\nsites occur; geological deposits, and soils; past and present ecological zones; vegetation \\nand animal communities; archaeological and historical (traditional) settlement patterns; and \\nthe communication features linking prehistoric and historic sites into a regional network \\n(e.g., river routes, portages, trails, and roads). \\n\\nLocal data consists of individual cultural/palaeontological sites or sites clusters; the \\ninformation contained within the sites as they relate to stratigraphic and spatial \\nrelationships within the context of the regional data (e.g., standing buildings and building \\nremains) and activity areas. Site data consists of the individual items or remains occurring \\nat the sites (e.g., artifacts and features). \\n\\n13.11.2.3.2 Nature of Impact \\n\\nPotential impacts of the proposed Project on the three types of heritage resource \\nphenomena may be primary, secondary or tertiary. Nature of impact must be viewed in \\nterms of type of activities required for development of the project and post-construction \\nactivities. Primary impacts are predictable, planned disturbance factors necessitated by \\nthe objectives of the proposed Project. Relative to the Project, the primary impact zones \\nare the Pipeline ROW and the locations of ancillary facilities (borrow areas, construction \\ncamps, access roads, shoo-flys and staging facilities), bank stabilization, and land \\nreclamation programs. Primary impacts necessitated by the objectives of the proposed \\nProject that could potentially affect archaeological resources include the compaction and \\ndisplacement of sites occurring on or near the surface as a result of vehicular activity. The \\nclearing of forested areas by mechanical means, particularly bulldozing, may also lead to \\ndisturbance of shallowly buried sites. Leveling of the development zones, in addition to \\npotentially disturbing shallowly buried sites, may also impact deeply buried sites. Deeply \\nburied sites may also be impacted during ditching operations, mining of borrow pits, \\nconstruction of access roads, and associated facilities. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT \\n\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN \\n\\n Page 13-200 \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nTable 13.11-2 Summary of Potential Development Impacts on Historical Resources \\nPhase Activity Nature of Impact Potential Effect on Historical Resources \\n\\nVehicular traffic Surface disturbance; removal of \\nvegetation \\n\\nDisturbance of surface cultural/fossil materials and contexts \\n\\nSoil testing Disturbance of surface and \\nsubsurface sediments \\n\\nDisturbance of surface and subsurface cultural/fossil materials \\nand contexts  \\n\\nRemoval of forest cover Disturbance of surface historical resource features (cairns, \\nmarkers, tree blazes, trails, burials, etc.) and surface \\ncultural/fossil materials and contexts in shallow sediments  \\n\\nSoil compaction Disturbance and compression of surface and subsurface \\ndeposits; possible breakage of individual cultural/fossil \\nspecimens \\n\\nExploration/Assessment/ \\nSite Preparation \\n\\nClearing of \\nvegetation \\n\\nSoil erosion Disturbance of surface and subsurface cultural/fossil deposits; \\nloss of exposed or intercepted historical resource sites \\n\\nGrading of landscapes Disturbance of surface and shallowly buried historical resource \\ndeposits; loss of information about context, including provenience \\ndata for cultural/fossil materials; mixing of stratigraphic levels \\n\\nExcavation Disturbance of surface and buried historical resource deposits; \\nloss of information about context, including provenience data for \\ncultural/fossil materials; mixing of stratigraphic levels; disturbance \\nof traditional use sites of significance \\n\\nSoil compaction Disturbance and compression of surface and subsurface \\ndeposits; possible breakage of individual cultural/fossil \\nspecimens \\n\\nSoil erosion Disturbance of surface and subsurface cultural/fossil deposits; \\nloss of exposed or intercepted historical resource sites \\n\\nGrading/topsoil \\nstripping/trenching \\nReclamation \\nactivities \\n\\nMixing of soil horizons Loss of information about context, including provenience data for \\ncultural/fossil materials \\n\\nConstruction/ \\nOperation/ \\nClosure \\n\\nEmergency fuel \\nspills \\n\\nContamination of soils and \\nvegetation \\n\\nContamination of surface and buried historical resource deposits \\nand materials; destruction of ability to radiocarbon date cultural \\nmaterials \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT \\n\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN \\n\\n Page 13-201 \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nTable 13.11-2 Summary of Potential Development Impacts on Historical Resources (cont’d) \\nPhase Activity Nature of Impact Potential Effect on Historical Resources \\n\\nEmergency fuel \\nspills (cont’d) \\n\\nContainment of contaminated \\nsoils and vegetation \\n\\nDisturbance of surface and buried historical resource deposits; \\nloss of information about context, including provenience data for \\ncultural/fossil materials; mixing of stratigraphic levels \\n\\nIncreased wind throw and \\nerosion from tree and \\nvegetation loss \\n\\nDisturbance to surface and shallowly buried historical resource \\ndeposits; loss of contextual information about exposed or \\nintercepted sites \\n\\nPresence of roads, \\npower and pipeline \\nrights-of-way \\n\\nImproved access  Potential disturbance through vandalism or unauthorized \\ncollection of exposed or intercepted cultural/fossil deposits; \\nincreases non-aboriginal use of areas not previously affected by \\nsport hunting/fishing \\n\\nConstruction/ \\nOperation/ \\nClosure (cont’d) \\n\\nIncreased human \\ntraffic \\n\\nIncreased vehicular /foot traffic Disturbance of surface and shallowly buried historical resource \\nsites; loss of information about context, including provenience \\ndata for cultural/fossil materials; mixing of stratigraphic levels; \\nincreased potential for vandalism or unauthorized collection of \\nhistorical resource materials \\n\\nSource: Fedirchuk McCullough & Associates Ltd. 1997 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-202\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nTraditional land use, currently operative, could be impacted if the proposed Pipeline route \\nintercepts or approaches areas of significance to First Nations peoples. Areas of \\nsignificance are highly variable in definition, ranging from traplines to spiritual or sacred \\nsites. Only through interviews with members of the local First Nation community can these \\nareas be identified. \\n\\nBlasting or ripping may occur during construction. Should palaeontological sites be present, \\nthey will be impacted by both blasting and ripping procedures. Potential unplanned impacts \\nwhich could affect palaeontological resources include unauthorized collection of \\npalaeontological specimens. \\n\\nSecondary impacts are adverse effects on heritage resources which may occur during \\noperationalization of the Project but may also occur during construction as a result of \\nProject expansion and minor modifications to project design. Secondary impact zones \\ninclude site areas immediately adjacent to the ROW, access roads, and facility locations. \\n\\nPotentially, expansion of use areas associated with pipeline facilities and reclamation may \\ndisturb shallowly buried deposits situated immediately adjacent to the ROW and facilities. \\nMobilization of heavy equipment to aid in repair and clean-up of accidental spills/leaks can \\nalso potentially impact similarly located sites. \\n\\nTertiary impacts are not directly related to construction of the development facility. They \\nare the result of project induced changes in land use. Tertiary effects involve the collection \\nof artifacts by unauthorized individuals and vandalism. Tertiary impact zones include all site \\nareas accessible via the ROW. \\n\\n13.11.2.3.3 Degree of Impact \\n\\nA major impact is defined as the loss of a significant proportion of data at the local or \\nregional site level. With major impact, the interpretative capacity of the heritage resource \\nfollowing impact is minimal. Moderate impact is defined as the loss of a proportion of data \\nat the local or regional site level with a significant proportion of data remaining unimpaired. \\nAfter moderate impact, the interpretative capacity of the heritage resource is hindered by \\nthe loss of basic data about the past. Minor impact is defined as the loss of a minor \\nproportion of data at the local or regional site level. After minor impact, the interpretative \\ncapacity of the heritage resource is virtually intact, limited only by the loss of minor items \\nand features.  \\n\\n13.11.2.4 Lack of Previous Inventory \\n\\nNo previous inventory of heritage resources has been conducted along the proposed ROW \\nand it is therefore not currently possible to evaluate the impacts of the Project on the \\nheritage resources within the development zone. An assessment of the heritage resources \\nis required. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-203\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.11.3 Study Area \\n\\nThe LSA was used to complete the historical resources assessment. The LSA was defined \\nas the 25-m wide ROW of the preferred route, including additional temporary workspace at \\nstream crossings, heavy grade areas, timber decking sites, and facility/road crossings. \\n\\n13.11.4 Proposed Assessment \\n\\n13.11.4.1 Heritage Resource Program \\n\\nA heritage resource program is designed to locate and assess the significance of heritage \\nresource sites relative to project impacts, and to recommend mitigative strategies \\nappropriate to the level of impact. For the proposed Project, the Heritage Resource Impact \\nAssessment conducted will conform to all standard practices of both the British Columbia \\n(Archaeology Branch) and Alberta (Alberta Community Development) jurisdictions. All \\nstudies will be conducted under provincially administered permits, and will consist of \\nsurface reconnaissance and subsurface investigations using controlled shovel testing. \\nLaboratory and analytic studies will evaluate the sites and their significance. Previously \\nrecorded sites will be relocated if situated within the study corridor and the significance of \\nboth these and newly identified sites will be assessed in terms of context, contents and \\noverall interpretive potential. The potential effects of the proposed Pipeline on the identified \\nheritage resources will be evaluated relative to interpreted site significance, and mitigative \\nrecommendations will be made for each identified site.  \\n\\nA report will be submitted to Alberta Community Development and the Archaeological \\nBranch (British Columbia) detailing the findings of the investigation. Review of these reports \\nwill result in the setting of final Provincial government requirements for the mitigation of the \\nheritage resources identified.  \\n\\n13.11.4.1.1 Route Evaluation \\n\\nAerial reconnaissance by helicopter will be conducted over the proposed Project area in \\norder to identify and assess the archaeological potential of remote areas of the Project \\nbased on topographic features. Consultation with members of the involved First Nations will \\nalso contribute to identification of potential areas of study not identified by physiographic \\nassociations.  \\n\\nThe site file search, literature review, and the mapping data will be used to evaluate the \\ncorridor as to archaeological and historic site potential. Using recorded physiographic \\nassociations of archaeological sites on file with the British Columbia Heritage Branch, and \\nrecorded patterns of aboriginal land use, terrain features most commonly associated with \\nprecontact sites and documented historic use will be identified and targeted for \\nexamination. In addition, a variety of different environments with potential for sites of \\ngreater antiquity will also be targeted for inspection.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-204\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.11.4.1.2 Ground Reconnaissance \\n\\nThe entire ROW will be assessed in the field to determine areas of medium to high \\npotential for containing archaeological resources. All areas of medium to high \\narchaeological potential within the proposed study corridor will be intensively examined \\nusing pedestrian traverses by two archaeologists and assistants from each of the two local \\nFirst Nations. These areas include stream terraces/benches, pronounced topographic \\nfeatures such as summits and escarpments, well drained features in otherwise poorly \\ndrained terrain, areas providing exceptional views or outlook, and areas of specific \\nresource procurement potential such as quarries and mineral licks. All fortuitous exposures \\nwill be examined for cultural materials; and shovel tests (each approximately 40 X 40 cm) \\nwill be judgmentally placed within the ROW in areas deemed to be of medium to high \\npotential. The number of shovel tests excavated along the proposed ROW is at the \\ndiscretion of the field archaeologist(s) depending on the nature of the topography on the \\nROW. Gravels, bedrock or C soil horizons are used as limits for the depth of the shovel \\ntests. \\n\\nSite identification includes examination for, and recording of, culturally modified trees \\n(CMT) which may indicate precontact forest use such as bark stripping or tree felling. \\nIndicators of trail blazing will be noted if there is a suggestion of substantive age (over 50 \\nyears old). In the event CMTs are identified, all CMT sites will be recorded using Level II \\nRecording Techniques. This includes the completion of a Level II CMT Recording Form and \\nthe completion of a detailed site map showing the location of the individual CMTs. Tree \\ncores will be collected from each site in order to date the activity. At CMT sites with over \\n5 modified trees, 20 percent of the trees will be cored for dating, to a maximum of 20 trees \\nper site. \\n\\nSubsurface testing will be undertaken at any sites identified to determine the nature of the \\nsite and the impact from development. Emphasis is placed on identifying site perimeters \\n(both horizontal and vertical), site integrity, internal structure of the site, and scientific \\npotential allowing for the formulation of recommendations for appropriate mitigation \\nmeasures. In the event that shovel tests prove to be inadequate for establishing site \\nsignificance (e.g., the deposits are very deep, or there is some question as to stratigraphic \\nintegrity or quality), evaluative tests will be excavated. Evaluative tests will be either 50 cm \\nby one meter, or one meter by one meter square, depending upon the nature of the data \\nrequired to provide thorough evaluation. Evaluative tests will be excavated by either shovel \\nand/or trowel, depending on the nature, density, and distribution of cultural material and the \\nresulting sediments would be screened through a six millimeter mesh hand screen. Either \\nnatural stratigraphic levels or arbitrary 10 cm levels will be used for vertical control, \\ndepending on the nature of the sediments and the cultural materials observed (i.e., should \\ndiscernible stratigraphy be present, observable levels were to have been used for vertical \\ncontrol). \\n\\nIn the event that cultural material is observed on the surface or in exposures, a \\nrepresentative sample will be collected after the location is marked on an appropriate \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-205\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nsketch plan. If the site consists of a limited number of artifacts (i.e., less than 10), all \\nspecimens will be collected. All formed tools and diagnostic artifacts will be collected. \\nDetailed recording of site characteristics will be conducted, including observations of depth \\nof surface cover, thickness of cultural deposit, sedimentary conditions, and cultural \\nmaterials observed. A written and photographic documentation of stratigraphic conditions \\nwill be recorded. In general, observed cultural materials will be collected, bagged, and \\nrecorded as individual provenience locations and retained for analysis. All artifacts will be \\nanalyzed according to standard archaeological practice: lithic artifacts will be assigned to a \\nspecific artifact type and material type; tools will be measured and morphological attributes \\ndiscussed in detail; where possible, cultural associations will be identified; faunal material \\nwill be assigned to class, genus, or species, element determined, and if possible, sided. If \\npalaeontological specimens are observed, representative samples will be collected for \\nidentification by a palaeontologist and all palaeontological sites recorded.  \\n\\nSignificance of all archaeological deposits identified is determined on the basis of scientific, \\npublic, ethnic and historic significance. These levels of significance will be evaluated in \\nview of the undisturbed nature of the deposits, the ability of the deposits to yield information \\nregarding temporal and/or cultural affiliations, the nature of the impacts experienced by the \\ndeposits, and the accumulated effect of impact to identified sites in view of their relationship \\nto the provincial database. The specific selection of criteria used to evaluate a site’s \\nsignificance conforms to those identified in Appendices D and E of the British Columbia \\nArchaeological Impact Assessment Guidelines (1996). Classification of precontact and \\nhistoric sites identified follows the British Columbia Archaeological Site Inventory Form \\nGuide (1998) and the Provincial Museum of Alberta Archaeological Inventory Site Data \\nForm Guide. The level of impact to heritage resources is identified with respect to the \\nfollowing criteria: the magnitude, severity, duration, range, diversity and frequency of the \\nimpact, as well as the cumulative effect and the rate of change.  \\n\\n13.11.4.1.3 Formulation of Recommendations \\n\\nSite specific recommendations are formulated primarily on the basis of the level of available \\ninformation and the perceived values within the context of the predicted impact. Due to the \\nnon-renewable and irreversible nature of historic resources, avoidance as a mitigation \\nmeasure is recommended as the preferred option at sites with established heritage \\nresource values. Sites of limited scientific and ethnic value (for example, isolated artifact \\nfinds or fossil fragments) are generally not recommended for further study and are not \\nconsidered for avoidance mitigation as the data collected at the Heritage Resource Impact \\nAssessment stage has effectively reduced or eliminated impact from the proposed \\ndevelopment. Further study is recommended at sites which cannot be avoided and at which \\nthe data collected during the impact assessment stage are considered insufficient to \\nmitigate effects from the proposed development.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-206\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.11.4.1.4 Heritage Resource Values \\n\\nCriteria for evaluating heritage resource values are provided in the Archaeological Impact \\nAssessment Guidelines (Appendices D, E) (1996) developed by The British Columbia \\nArchaeology Branch. Depending on the nature of the specific resource, the following \\ncriteria are used to assign heritage resource values to the sites identified during the field \\nprogram. \\n\\n13.11.4.1.4.1 Scientific Value \\n\\nThe potential of a site to enhance current understanding of cultural or natural history and \\ndevelopment as well as its potential to shed light on current research problems are \\nattributes of scientific value. Of prime importance to scientific value is site integrity, that is \\nwhether or not it has been disturbed. The frame of reference for evaluation of scientific \\nvalue can consist of either the site, local or regional level, of scientific data. For example, \\nbecause our knowledge of details of precontact lifestyle is incomplete, often dictated by \\nvagaries of past human use and discard, as well as preservation, all three levels of data \\nmust be considered when determining scientific archaeological value. However, the first \\norder of scientific evaluation occurs at the site level. Only after the potential of a site to \\nprovide substantive data has been established, are local and regional implications \\nconsidered. \\n\\n13.11.4.1.4.2 Public Value \\n\\nPublic or social value of historic and archaeological sites is evaluated from the perspective \\nof their potential to contribute to public understanding or appreciation of past human \\nlifestyles and their potential for development as interpretive or tourist facilities. Current use \\nor visitation by the public, as well as public concern expressed at community consultation \\nmeetings are also considered in ascribing public value to a site.  \\n\\n13.11.4.1.4.3 Ethnic Value \\n\\nEthnic value is based either on the perceived value of a site to a particular ethnic group or \\non expressed importance to a particular group. Traditional land use sites are evaluated \\nprimarily from the perspective of ethnic value. \\n\\n13.11.4.1.4.4 Historical Value \\n\\nHistorical value is relevant only to historic sites and is based on the association of a \\nparticular site with personages, themes or events that have important or lasting \\ncontributions to society on a local or regional level. Other factors considered include the \\npresence of physical structural remains and the potential of the archaeological remains to \\nprovide information relating to consumption, provisioning, disposal, ethnic and social \\nstratification, technological development, and economic transitions. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-207\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.11.5 Mitigative Options \\n\\nPrimary impacts to heritage resource sites can be significantly reduced or eliminated by \\navoidance or adequate study. Avoidance is the preferred option when practical, as the \\narchaeological excavation alternative amounts to the controlled destruction of the site’s \\ncontext in the recovery of its contents. In-situ Historical/Heritage Resource values are lost. \\nAvoidance may be accomplished in linear disturbances, such as pipelines, through ROW \\nrelocation, offset, restriction of construction zones, and alteration of standard construction \\ntechniques, such as non-removal of top-soil from the proposed ROW, laying down of \\nprotective working surfaces or site flagging. Many of these options apply to surface or near-\\nsurface Historical/Heritage Resources which might be affected in ROW preparation and \\nconstruction activities within the ROW. Options for significant Historical/Heritage Resources \\nwhich lie buried below the surface and might be affected by ditching activities are limited to \\nthe relocation of the ditch line and the ROW outside the site area or area of significance. \\nWhere disturbance is unavoidable and avoidance is not a satisfactory or feasible option, \\nmitigation by controlled archaeological excavation/collection from significant sites is the \\nrecommended procedure. \\n\\nAdequate study generally involves scientific investigations which are designed to \\nsystematically explore and reconstruct the activities which were carried out at the sites. \\nInvestigations usually involve excavation of buried sites, detailed controlled collection of \\nsurface sites, detailed mapping, and photographic documentation. In some instances, \\nhowever, photographic documentation, recording, and if necessary, the collection of \\nspecimens are deemed to be sufficient mitigative measures. Adverse secondary impacts \\nwhich may occur during the construction phase can usually be effectively managed by \\nclose consultation between project planners and construction personnel. \\n\\nHeritage/Historical Resources Impact Assessment and Mitigation studies will mitigate the \\neffects which occur to significant Heritage/Historical Resources during construction, where \\navoidance is not feasible, through the conservation of the contexts and contents of affected \\nsignificant sites. \\n\\n13.11.6 Summary and Conclusions \\n\\nGiven the nature of archaeological resources in the Boreal Forest, and based on the results \\nof previous studies, it is highly unlikely that the heritage resource sites identified cannot be \\nmitigated through recording, collection, mitigation excavation or avoidance. A monitoring \\nprogram of construction activities will be implemented as a discovery technique to ensure \\nthat any additional sites are mitigated appropriately. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-208\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.12 Assessment of Upset Events \\n\\n13.12.1 Background \\n\\nUpset events represent unforeseen occurrences during the construction or operation of a \\nfacility that can have environmental implications. Section 16(1) of the Canadian \\nEnvironmental Assessment Act, requires that Responsible Authorities consider the effects \\nof potential upset events. \\n\\nFrom a pipeline perspective, upset events can include a wide variety of possible scenarios. \\nA pipeline rupture and explosion represents a ‘worst case’ scenario with potentially the \\ngreatest environmental implications, but it is a very low probability event. In addition, the \\nenvironmental implications of such an event will vary widely, depending on the location, \\ntiming, and other factors surrounding the event. Therefore, there is little value in \\nconsidering a scenario that is highly speculative and highly unlikely. \\n\\nA more reasonable approach is to select events that reflects that actual setting and \\ncircumstances surrounding the Project, and has a reasonable probability of occurring. For \\nthis Project, two events are assessed: a failed HDD crossing of the Hay River and flaring of \\npipeline blowdown \\n\\n13.12.2 Failed HDD Crossing \\n\\n13.12.2.1 Assumptions \\n\\nThe following scenario has been considered: \\n\\n• During the HDD crossing of the Hay, circulation will be lost, and drilling mud will \\nmigrate into the river channel at and adjacent to the drilling site. \\n\\n• The river will be supporting under ice flows of approximately 1 - 2 m3/sec. This is \\nlikely a overly conservative (high) estimate, considering that the river was frozen to \\nits substrates in February 2003.  \\n\\n• An isolated trenched crossing will be employed as a back-up crossing technique. \\n\\nThe isolated trenched crossing technique will follow the procedures outlined in the \\nEnvironmental Protection Plan and Watercourse Crossing Report (See Appendix 13D, \\nEnvironmental Protection Plan) \\n\\n13.12.2.2 Instream Habitat Alteration \\n\\nUnder this scenario, instream habitat conditions could be adversely influenced by:  \\n\\n• the deposition of drilling muds onto the stream substrates \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-209\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n• extensive grading of the banks to facilitate trenching and pipe lower-in \\n\\n• instream trenching and associated sedimentation issues \\n\\nDrilling Mud Issues. To limit the potential for mud introductions into the channel, \\ndownstream water clarity and substrate monitoring will be undertaken throughout the entire \\ndrilling procedure. Sudden increases in turbidity or drilling mud discoloration of substrate \\nmaterial will be immediately reported to the Environmental Inspector and HDD supervisor. \\nDrilling shutdown criteria will be in place in the event of mud detection or circulation \\npressure losses, whichever comes first. Decisions to attempt a new drill path alignment or \\nto abandon further drilling attempts will be based on the severity of mud detection and \\ncirculation pressure loss. Detailed criteria for abandonment are found in the Watercourse \\nCrossing Report, Appendix 13D, Environmental Protection Plan. \\n\\nWith these contingency measures in place, mud introductions into the channel are \\nexpected to be minimal. In addition, preliminary habitat assessments at the site suggest \\nthat the reach near the crossing is dominated by low diversity run habitat with fine \\nsubstrates and limited instream cover. Consequently, limited mud introductions into such a \\nreach would likely have a limited effect the low quality habitat. \\n\\nBank and Bed Issues. If an isolated trenched crossing is required as a contingency plan, \\nthe location of the crossing will be finalized based on fisheries and habitat investigations to \\nbe undertaken in May 2003. If important habitat components (e.g., instream coarse woody \\ndebris cover, gravelly substrates) are identified in this reach of river, the crossing site would \\nbe adjusted to avoid these features and reduce the potential for a harmful alteration, \\ndisruption or destruction under Section 35(2) of the Fisheries Act. Based on current \\nknowledge of the site, any adjustments to the location would be minor (i.e., less than 50 m), \\nand would not have other significant environmental implications.  \\n\\nConsiderable grading of the 5 m-high banks will be required for a trenched crossing. While \\na number of standard protection practices would be followed to limit material introductions \\ninto the channel (i.e., grading of bank material away from the channel into extra workspace, \\n15 m buffer of vegetation between channel and extra workspace), there will be a loss of \\nvertical bank structure, particularly at the cutting bank on the east side of the channel. \\nConsequently, restoration measures would focus on the reconstruction and stabilization of \\nthe cutting bank to prevent unnatural channel migration and bank erosion after \\nconstruction. Given the lack of cobble or rock for gabion construction or armouring at the \\nsite, reconstruction measures would likely involve the installation of a buried log crib \\nstructure that would provide both vertical structure and bank stability. A preliminary \\ngeotechnical evaluation of the site has indicated that such a procedure would be effective, \\nparticularly given the low flow rates and limited erosion potential of the river. \\n\\nTrenching in the river could potentially effect substrate characteristics through material \\nmixing and instream sediment loading. It is anticipated that substrates will consist of fine \\nfluvials to trench bottom. However, if different textured materials are encountered with \\ndepth, these materials will be stockpiled separately and backfilled into the trench in their \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-210\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nnatural sequence to minimize changes to substrate characteristics. Instream sedimentation \\nwill be controlled through the use of trench isolation dams (sheet piling) and pump around \\nsystems to maintain clean downstream water flows. Given the deep soft substrates of the \\nriver, defined channel and easily-managed, anticipated flows, it is reasonable to assume \\nthat a dam and pump system will be very effective in controlling downstream \\nsedimentation. In addition, the sediment size of channel substrate at normal winter \\ndischarge is favourable to quick deposition in a relatively short distance downstream of \\neach crossing, even if some material escapes the isolated area. \\n\\nIt is also expected that any trench dewatering undertaken within the isolated area can be \\neffectively managed. On the east side of the river, there are several dry meander scars \\n(see Appendix 13A, Environmental Alignment Sheets, Sheet 9) that are more than large \\nenough to accommodate dewatering quantities. These features are ideal sediment \\ndeposition zones, and would prevent any sediment-ladened water from re-entering the \\nriver.  \\n\\n13.12.2.3 Alteration of Flow Patterns \\n\\nTrenching activities in combination with inadequate dam and pump-around facilities could \\ninfluence downstream flows. However, with an estimated 1 –2 m3/sec of flow to manage, \\nthere is little potential for serious flow disruptions. A back-up pumping system with \\ncomparable capacity to the primary pumps would be present on site to accommodate any \\nequipment failures.  \\n\\n13.12.2.4 Summary \\n\\nIn summary, it is not anticipated that a failed HDD crossing at the Hay would result in \\nmeasurable, medium to long term effects on fish abundance/diversity or stream productive \\ncapacity. The low habitat quality afforded by the river, particularly during winter, coupled \\nwith more detailed habitat information to be collected this spring, and the ability to \\neffectively manage a contingency crossing all point to the minimal effects of such an upset \\nevent.   \\n\\n13.12.3 Flaring of Pipeline Blowdown \\n\\nThere are no significant sources of pollutants associated with the normal operation of the \\nPipeline. In an emergency case however, some of the contents of the Pipeline (sweet, dry \\nnatural gas) may be flared. This scenario is expected to be a very rare occurrence.   \\n\\nUpset events occur when a portion of the gas in the Pipeline is burned off to the \\natmosphere to clear the Pipeline and/or relieve its pressure. Flaring would occur at either \\nend of the Pipeline and result in combustion emissions comprised primarily of carbon \\ndioxide, water vapour, nitrogen oxides, and trace amounts of hydrocarbon compounds. \\nWhen operational, the total volume of gas in the Pipeline will be about 1.9 million m³ (at \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-211\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\nstandard conditions). During each event, one-third of the contents (630,000 m³) would be \\nflared resulting in approximately 622 kg of NOX being emitted into the atmosphere. \\n\\nDue to the transient and infrequent nature of the upset events, the potential effects to local \\nand regional air quality are expected to be negligible. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\nAND MITIGATION PLAN\\n\\n Page 13-212\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nEnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. \\n\\n13.13 References \\n\\n13.13.1 Literature Cited \\n\\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada. 1994.
